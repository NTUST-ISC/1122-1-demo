N

NAPOLEON, a little Frenchman who wore a big hat, a little curl on his
forehead, and whose ambitions were larger than his good luck. Started
life by placing Corsica on the map. Like all great men, he was the
dunce at school. Later he used his masters and prize-winning chums
as first-row soldiers. Entered the army. Never succeeded as a sentry.
Frequently amused himself by taking a couple of soldiers and capturing
a city or an army between meals. The politicians in Paris saw the young
man was not without talents. They gave him a few more soldiers. Then he
went after countries. Captured Egypt, but had trouble with one Nelson of
England. N. became unpopular with his neighbors. They all attacked him.
He attacked them all. That settled it. He ate wars. After the powers
were powerless N. scampered about Europe adding countries to France. He
devoured Germany. Went after Russia, but they made it too hot and too
cold for him. Had more trouble with that man Nelson. Became rich and
divorced. Introduced Roosevelt publicity tactics into France and carried
a third term. Started things. Began quarreling again. At last he was
cooped up in Paris, and flew the white flag. Visited Elba. Revisited
France. Started things again. Took some veterans to Belgium. There he
was met by another Englishman by the name of Wellington who introduced
him to Waterloo. For his kindness in leaving Europe England presented
N. with a whole island, a complementary guard, and paid all his living
expenses for six years. Later N. became responsible for one of the
sights of Paris. Always carried his right hand in the front of his coat.

father's money by going to college, shooting lions, and raising a large
family. During the Spanish-American War he employed a troop of rough
riders, stormed San Juan Hill, and got into the newspapers. Made up
his mind he would stay there. R. became governor of New York State with
ambitions. Being a wealthy man, and capable of contributing to the cause
of the Republican party, he was elected vice-president of the United
States. A hand other than his own made him president. Here his newspaper
career really began. R. first opened a three-ring circus in the White
House, wore a rough rider hat, and told the country what a great
president he was. The voters believed him, and did not object to four
years more. During this administration R. successfully advertised
himself, the family, started the Panama Canal, and appointed one William
Howard Taft (see Poor Bill) his successor. R. then traveled through
Africa with a magnificent body guard of photographers and newspaper men.

king how to king and the emperors how to emp. Returning to the United
States he placed his hand in state politics. Fingers were badly burned.
When it came time to elect another president, R. was tired of scene
shifting and yearned for the bouquets of the audience. He girded up
his loins with the robes of sanctity, placed an international Harvester
Trust halo over his head, and proclaimed himself a second Moses who was
destined to lead the children of America out of the Land of the Frying
Pan into that of the Fire. With a mighty army of politicians, who also
wanted to get back, R. started his campaign with such a huge band he
could not hear any others. The fight was based on telling the voters
how easily they had been deceived four years earlier in what he had told
them concerning that "molycoddle Taft." R. was elected by the greatest
majority in history until the ballots were hatched. Later he joined the
ranks of William Jennings Bryan. Publications: The "I" books. Ambition:

a city and a big church to hold his family. Wrote a number of popular
songs. His proverbs also had a big sale. Ambition: Just one more wife
and an end to those quarrels in the harem. Recreations: Picnics with

Much Money. Early days spent at home. She married and began her career.

direction. Being denied high office in their ranks because of lack of
adequate cerebration, she set up a rival organization where brains were

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
