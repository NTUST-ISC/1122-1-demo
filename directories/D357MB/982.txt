BOOK OF NONSENSE

By Edward Lear



         There was an Old Derry down Derry,
         Who loved to see little folks merry;
         So he made them a Book,
         And with laughter they shook,
         At the fun of that Derry down Derry!




          TO THE GREAT-GRANDCHILDREN,
          GRAND-NEPHEWS, AND GRAND-NIECES
          OF EDWARD, 13th EARL OF DERBY,

          THIS BOOK OF DRAWINGS AND VERSES

          (The greater part of which were originally
          made and composed for their parents,)

          IS DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR,

          EDWARD LEAR





1.

               There was an Old Man with a beard,
               Who said, "It is just as I feared!--
               Two Owls and a Hen,
               Four Larks and a Wren,
               Have all built their nests in my beard!"




2.

               There was a Young Lady of Ryde,
               Whose shoe-strings were seldom untied;
               She purchased some clogs,
               And some small spotty dogs,
               And frequently walked about Ryde.




3.

               There was an Old Man with a nose,
               Who said, "If you choose to suppose,
               That my nose is too long,
               You are certainly wrong!"
               That remarkable Man with a nose.




4.

               There was an Old Man on a hill,
               Who seldom, if ever, stood still;
               He ran up and down,
               In his Grandmother's gown,
               Which adorned that Old Man on a hill.




5.

               There was a Young Lady whose bonnet,
               Came untied when the birds sate upon it;
               But she said, "I don't care!
               All the birds in the air
               Are welcome to sit on my bonnet!"




6.

               There was a Young Person of Smyrna,
               Whose Grandmother threatened to burn her;
               But she seized on the Cat,
               And said, "Granny, burn that!
               "You incongruous Old Woman of Smyrna!"




7.

               There was an Old Person of Chili,
               Whose conduct was painful and silly;
               He sate on the stairs,
               Eating apples and pears,
               That imprudent Old Person of Chili.




8.

               There was an Old Man with a gong,
               Who bumped at it all the day long;
               But they called out, "O law!
               You're a horrid old bore!"
               So they smashed that Old Man with a gong.




9.

               There was an Old Lady of Chertsey,
               Who made a remarkable curtsey;
               She twirled round and round,
               Till she sunk underground,
               Which distressed all the people of Chertsey.




10.

               There was an Old Man in a tree,
               Who was horribly bored by a Bee;
               When they said, "Does it buzz?"
               He replied, "Yes, it does!
               "It's a regular brute of a Bee!"




11.

               There was an Old Man with a flute,
               A sarpint ran into his boot;
               But he played day and night,
               Till the sarpint took flight,
               And avoided that man with a flute.




12.

               There was a Young Lady whose chin,
               Resembled the point of a pin:
               So she had it made sharp,
               And purchased a harp,
               And played several tunes with her chin.




13.

               There was an Old Man of Kilkenny,
               Who never had more than a penny;
               He spent all that money,
               In onions and honey,
               That wayward Old Man of Kilkenny.




14.

               There was an Old Person of Ischia,
               Whose conduct grew friskier and friskier;
               He danced hornpipes and jigs,
               And ate thousands of figs,
               That lively Old Person of Ischia.




15.

               There was an Old Man in a boat,
               Who said, "I'm afloat! I'm afloat!"
               When they said, "No! you ain't!"
               He was ready to faint,
               That unhappy Old Man in a boat.




16.

               There was a Young lady of Portugal,
               Whose ideas were excessively nautical;
               She climbed up a tree,
               To examine the sea,
               But declared she would never leave Portugal.




17.

               There was an Old Man of Moldavia,
               Who had the most curious behaviour;
               For while he was able,
               He slept on a table,
               That funny Old Man of Moldavia




18.

               There was an Old Man of Madras,
               Who rode on a cream-coloured ass;
               But the length of its ears,
               So promoted his fears,
               That it killed that Old Man of Madras.




19.

               There was an Old Person of Leeds,
               Whose head was infested with beads;
               She sat on a stool,
               And ate gooseberry fool,
               Which agreed with that person of Leeds.




20.

               There was an Old Man of Peru,
               Who never knew what he should do;
               So he tore off his hair,
               And behaved like a bear,
               That intrinsic Old Man of Peru.




21.

               There was an Old Person of Hurst,
               Who drank when he was not athirst;
               When they said, "You'll grow fatter,"
               He answered, "What matter?"
               That globular Person of Hurst.




22.

               There was a Young person of Crete,
               Whose toilette was far from complete;
               She dressed in a sack,
               Spickle-speckled with black,
               That ombliferous person of Crete.




23.

               There was an Old Man of the Isles,
               Whose face was pervaded with smiles;
               He sung high dum diddle,
               And played on the fiddle,
               That amiable Man of the Isles.




24.

               There was an Old Person of Buda,
               Whose conduct grew ruder and ruder;
               Till at last, with a hammer,

26.

               There was a young Lady of Dorking,
               Who bought a large bonnet for walking;
               But its colour and size,
               So bedazzled her eyes,
               That she very soon went back to Dorking.




27.

               There was an Old Man who supposed,
               That the street door was partially closed;
               But some very large rats,

               While that futile old gentleman dozed.




28.

30.

               There was a Young Lady whose eyes,
               Were unique as to colour and size;

               And started away in surprise.




31.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
