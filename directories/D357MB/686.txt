of the movement of capital to or from third countries involving direct

Treaty, the Council may, acting by a qualified majority on a proposal
from the Commission, adopt measures on the movement of capital to
or from third countries involving direct investment - including
investment in real estate -, establishment, the provision of financial

compatible with this Treaty.
3. The measures and procedures referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2

December 1993, enjoy a derogation on the basis of existing
Community law, shall be entitled to maintain, until 31 December 1995

derogations as exist on that date.
ARTICLE 73f

third countries cause, or threaten to cause, serious difficulties for the

payment connected with the movement of goods, services or capital,
and any transfers of capital and earnings, to the extent that the
movement of goods, services, capital and persons between Member
States has been liberalized pursuant to this Treaty.
The Member States declare their readiness to undertake the
liberalization of payments beyond the extent provided in the preceding
subparagraph, in so far as their economic situation in general and the
state of their balance of payment in particular so permit.
2) In so far as movement of goods, services and capital are limited
only by restrictions on payments connected therewith, these
restrictions shall be progressively abolished by applying, mutatis
mutandis, the provisions of this Chapter and the Chapters relating to
the abolition of qualitative restrictions and to the liberalization of
services.
3) Member States undertake not to introduce between themselves any
new restrictions on transfers connected with the invisible transactions

1, where the application of provisions concerning the principles of the
regulatory system for transport would be liable to have a serious
effect on the standard of living and on employment in certain areas
and on the operation of transport facilities, they shall be laid down by
the Council acting unanimously on a proposal from the Commission,
after consulting the European Parliament and the Economic and Social
Committee. In so doing, the Council shall take into account the need
for adaptation to the economic development which will result from
establishing the common market."

the deficit reduction which is judged necessary by the Council in order
to remedy the situation.
In such a case, the Council may request the Member State concerned
to submit reports in accordance with a specific timetable in order to

public recommendations, it shall, as soon as the decision under
paragraph 8 has been abrogated, make a public statement that an
excessive deficit in the Member State concerned no longer exists.

decision which, although in the form of a regulation or a decision
addressed to another person, is of direct and individual concern to the
former.
The proceedings provided for in this Article shall be instituted within
two months of the publication of the measure, or of its notification to
the plaintiff, or, in the absence thereof, of the day on which it came to
the knowledge of the latter, as the case may be."

The action shall be admissible only if the institution concerned has
first been called upon to act. If, within two months of being so called
upon, the institution concerned has not defined its position, the action
may be brought within a further period of two months.
Any natural or legal person may, under the conditions laid down in the
preceding paragraphs, complain to the Court of Justice that an
institution of the Community has failed to address to that person any
act other than a recommendation or an opinion.

Community and of the ECB;
(c) the interpretation of the statutes of bodies established by an act of
the Council, where those statutes so provide.
Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a
Member State, that Court of tribunal may, if it considers that a decision
on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment, request the
Court of Justice to give a ruling thereon.
Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court or
tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no
judicial remedy under national law, the court or tribunal shall bring the
matter before the Court of Justice."

the European Investment Bank. In this connection, the Board of
Directors of the Bank shall enjoy the powers conferred upon the
Commission by Article 169;
(b) measures adopted by the Board of Governors of the European
Investment Bank. In this connection, any Member State, the
Commission of the Board of Directors of the Bank may institute
proceedings under the conditions laid down in Article 173;
(c) measures adopted by the Board of Directors of the European
Investment Bank. Proceedings against such measures may be
instituted only by Member States or by the Commission, under the
conditions laid down in Article 173, and solely on the grounds of non-
compliance with the procedure provided for in Article 21(2), (5), (6) and
(7) of the Statute of the Bank;
(d) the fulfillment by the national central banks of obligations under
this Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB. In this connection the powers

comply with the judgment of the Court of Justice."

competitiveness of the Community economy.
ARTICLE 2
1. With a view to achieving the objectives of Article 1, the Community

Committee.

management and labour have introduced the necessary measures by
agreement, the Member State concerned being required to take any
necessary measure enabling it at any time to be in a position to
guarantee the results imposed by that directive.

any Member State from maintaining or introducing more stringent
protective measures compatible with the Treaty.

association, the right to strike or the right to impose lock-outs.

direction of Community action.

recommendation.

months, unless the management and labour concerned and the
Commission decide jointly to extend it.
ARTICLE 4

them at Community level may lead to contractual relations, including
agreements.

agreement in question contains one or more provisions relating to one

prejudice to the other provisions of the Treaty, the Commission shall
encourage co-operation between the Member States and facilitate the
co-ordination of their action in all social policy fields under this
Agreement.
ARTICLE 6
1. Each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for
male and female workers for equal work is applied.
2. For the purpose of this Article, "pay" means the ordinary basic or
minimum wage or salary and any other consideration, whether in cash
or in kind, which the worker receives directly or indirectly, in respect of
his employment, from his employer.
Equal pay without discrimination based on sex means:
(a) that pay for the same work at piece rates shall be calculated on the
basis of the same unit of measurement.
(b) that pay for work at time rates shall be the same for the same job.
3. This Article shall not prevent any Member State from maintaining or

compensate for disadvantages in their professional careers.

achieving the objective of Article 1, including the demographic
situation in the Community. It shall forward the report to the European
Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee.

reports on particular problems concerning the social situation.
DECLARATIONS
1. Declaration on Article 2(2)
The eleven High Contracting Parties note that in the discussions on
Article 2(2) of the Agreement it was agreed that the Community does
not intend, in laying down minimum requirements for the protection of
the safety and health of employees, to discriminate in a manner
unjustified by the circumstances against employees in small and
medium-sized undertakings.
2. Declaration on Article 4(2)
The eleven High Contracting Parties declare that the first of the
arrangements for application of the agreements between management
and labour at Community level - referred to in Article 4(2) - will consist
in developing, by collective bargaining according to the rules of each
Member State, the content of the agreements, and that consequently
this arrangement implies no obligation on the Member States to apply
the agreements directly or to work out rules for their transposition, or
any obligation to amend national legislation in force to facilitate their
implementation.

The Conference of the Parliaments will be consulted on the main
features of the European Union, without prejudice to the powers of the
European Parliament and the rights of the national Parliaments. The
President of the European Council and the President of the
Commission will report to each session of the Conference of the
Parliaments on the state of the Union.
DECLARATION
ON THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMISSION AND OF THE
EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT
The Conference agrees that the Member States will examine the
questions relating to the number of members of the Commission and
the number of members of the European Parliament no later than at
the end of 1992, with a view to reaching an agreement which will
permit the establishment of the necessary legal basis for fixing the
number of members of the European Parliament in good time for the
1994 elections. The decisions will be taken in the light, inter alia, of
the need to establish the overall size of the European Parliament in an
enlarged Community.
DECLARATION
ON THE HIERARCHY OF COMMUNITY ACTS
The Conference agrees that the Intergovernmental Conference to be
convened in 1996 will examine to what extent it might be possible to
review the classification of Community acts with a view to establishing
an appropriate hierarchy between the different categories of act.
DECLARATION
ON THE RIGHT OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION
The Conference considers that transparency of the decision-making
process strengthens the democratic nature of the institutions and the
public's confidence in the administration. The Conference accordingly
recommends that the Commission submit to the Council no later than
1993 a report on measures designed to improve public access to the
information available to the institutions.
DECLARATION
ON ESTIMATED COSTS UNDER COMMISSION PROPOSALS
The Conference notes that the Commission undertakes, by basing
itself where appropriate on any consultations it considers necessary
and by strengthening its system for evaluating Community legislation,
to take account in its legislative proposals of costs and benefits to the
Member States' public authorities and all the parties concerned.
DECLARATION
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMUNITY LAW
1. The Conference stresses that it is central to the coherence and unity
of the process of European construction that each Member State
should fully and accurately transpose into national law the Community
Directives addressed to it within the deadlines laid down therein.
Moreover, the Conference, while recognizing that it must be for each
Member State to determine how the provisions of Community law can
best be enforced in the light of its own particular institutions, legal
system and other circumstances, but in any event in compliance with
Article 189 of the Treaty establishing the European Community,
considers it essential for the proper functioning of the Community that
the measures taken by the different Member States should result in
Community law being applied with the same effectiveness and rigour
as in the application of their national law.
2. The Conference calls on the Commission to ensure, in exercising its
powers under Article 155 of this Treaty, that Member States fulfill their
obligations. It asks the Commission to publish periodically a full report
for the Member States and the European Parliament.
DECLARATION
ON ASSESSMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF COMMUNITY
MEASURES
The Conference notes that the Commission undertakes in its
proposals, and that the Member States undertake in implementing
those proposals, to take full account of their environmental impact and
of the principle of sustainable growth.
DECLARATION
ON THE COURT OF AUDITORS
The Conference emphasizes the special importance it attaches to the
task assigned to the Court of Auditors by Articles 188a, 188b, 188c and
206 of the Treaty establishing the European Community.
It requests the other Community institutions to consider, together with
the Court of Auditors, all appropriate ways of enhancing the
effectiveness of its work.
DECLARATION ON THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE
The Conference agrees that the Economic and Social Committee will
enjoy the same independence with regard to its budget and staff
management as the Court Auditors has enjoyed hitherto.
DECLARATION
ON COOPERATION WITH CHARITABLE ASSOCIATIONS
The Conference stresses the importance, in pursuing the objectives of
Article 117 on the Treaty establishing the European Community, of co-
operation between the latter and charitable associations and
foundations as institutions responsible for social welfare
establishments and services.
DECLARATION
ON THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS
The Conference calls upon the European Parliament, the Council and
the Commission, as well as the Member States, when drafting and
implementing Community legislation on the common agricultural
policy, transport, the internal market and research, to pay full regard to
the welfare requirements of animals.
DECLARATION
ON THE REPRESENTATION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE OVERSEAS
COUNTRIES AND TERRITORIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 227(3)
AND (5)(a) AND (b) OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITY
The Conference, noting that in exceptional circumstances divergences
may arise between the interests of the Union and those of the
overseas countries and territories referred to in Article 227(3) and
(5)(a) and (b), agrees that the Council will seek to reach a solution
which accords with the position of the Union. However, in the event
that this proves impossible, the Conference agrees that the Member
State concerned may act separately in the interests of the said
overseas countries and territories, without this affecting the
Community's interests. The Member State concerned will give notice
to the Council and the Commission where such a divergence of
interests is likely to occur and, when separate action proves
unavoidable, make it clear that it is acting in the interests of overseas
territory mentioned above.
This declaration also applies to Macao and East Timor.
DECLARATION
ON THE OUTERMOST REGIONS OF THE COMMUNITY
The Conference acknowledges that the outermost regions of the
Community (the French overseas departments, Azores and Madeira
and Canary Islands) suffer from major structural backwardness
compounded by several phenomena (remoteness, island status, small
size, difficult topography and climate, economic dependence on a few
products), the permanence and combination of which severely restrain
their economic and social development.
It considers that, while the provisions of the Treaty establishing the
European Community and secondary legislation apply automatically to
outermost regions, it is nonetheless possible to adopt specific
measures to assist them inasmuch and as long as there is an
objective need to take such measures with a view to the economic and
social development of those regions. Such measures should have
their aim both the completion of the internal market and a recognition
of the regional reality to enable the outermost regions to achieve the
average economic and social level of the Community.
DECLARATION
ON VOTING IN THE FIELD OF THE COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY
POLICY
The Conference agrees that, with regard to Council decisions requiring
unanimity, Member States will, to the extent possible, avoid
preventing a unanimous decision where a qualified majority exists in
favour of that decision.
DECLARATION
ON PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS IN THE FIELD OF THE COMMON
FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY
The Conference agrees that the division of work between the Political
Committee and the Committee of Permanent Representatives will be
examined at a later stage, as will the practical arrangements for
merging the Political Co-operation Secretariat with the General
Secretariat of the Council and for co-operation between the latter and
the Commission.
DECLARATION ON THE USE OF LANGUAGES IN THE FIELD OF THE
COMMON FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY
The Conference agrees that the use of languages shall be in
accordance with the rules of the European Communities.
For COREU communications, the current practice of European political
co-operation will serve as a guide for the time being.
All common foreign and security policy texts which are submitted to or
adopted at meeting of the European Council and of the Council as well
as all texts which are to be published are immediately and
simultaneously translated into all the official Community languages.
DECLARATION
ON WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION
The Conference notes the following declarations:
I. DECLARATION
by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland, which are members of the Western European Union
and also members of the European Union on
THE ROLE OF THE WESTERN EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS RELATIONS
WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION AND WITH THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE
Introduction
1. WEU Member States agree on the need to develop a genuine
European security and defence identity and a greater European
responsibility on defence matters. This identity will be pursued
through a gradual process involving successive phases. WEU will
form an integral part of the process of the development of the
European Union and will enhance its contribution to solidarity within
the Atlantic Alliance. WEU Member States agree to strengthen the role
of WEU, in the longer term perspective of a common defence,
compatible with that of the Atlantic Alliance.
2. WEU will be developed as the defence component of the European
Union and as a means to strengthen the European pillar of the Atlantic
Alliance. To this end, it will formulate common European defence
policy and carry forward its concrete implementation through the
further development of its own operational role.
WEU Member States take note of Article J.4 relating to the common
foreign and security policy of the Treaty on European Union which
reads as follows:
"1. The common foreign and security policy shall include all questions
related to the security of the Union, including the eventual framing of a
common defence policy, which might in time lead to a common
defence.
2. The union requests the Western Union (WEU), which is an integral
part of the development of the Union, to elaborate and implement
decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.
The Council shall, in agreement with the institutions of the WEU, adopt
the necessary practical arrangements.
3. Issues having defence implications dealt with under this Article
shall not be subject to the procedures set out in Article J.3.
4. The policy of the Union in accordance with this Article shall not
prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of
certain Member States and shall respect the obligations of certain
Member States under the North Atlantic Treaty and be compatible with
the common security and defence policy established within that
framework.
5. The provisions of this Article shall not prevent the development of
closer co-operation between two or more Member States on a bilateral
level, in the framework of the WEU and the Atlantic Alliance, provided
such co-operation does not run counter to or impede that provided for
in this Title.
6. With a view to furthering the objective of this Treaty, and having in
view the date of 1998 in the context of Article XII of the Brussels
Treaty, the provisions of this Article may be revised as provided for in
Article N(2) on the basis of a report to be presented in 1996 by the
Council to the European Council, which shall include an evaluation of
the progress made and the experience gained until then."
A. WEU's relations with European Union
3. The objective is to build up WEU in stages as the defence
component of the European Union. To this end, WEU is prepared, at
the request of the European Union, to elaborate and implement
decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications.
To this end, WEU will take the following measures to develop a close
working relationship with the Union:
- as appropriate, synchronization of the dates and venues of meetings
and harmonization of working methods;
- establishment of close co-operation between the Council and
Secretariat-General of WEU on the one hand, and the Council of the
Union and General Secretariat of the Council on the other;
- consideration of the harmonization of the sequence and duration of
the respective Presidencies;
- arranging for appropriate modalities so as to ensure that the
Commission of the European Communities is regularly informed and,
as appropriate, consulted on WEU activities in accordance with the
role of the Commission in the common foreign and security policy as
defined in the Treaty on European Union;
- encouragement of closer co-operation between the Parliamentary
Assembly of WEU and the European Parliament.
The WEU Council shall, in agreement with the competent bodies of the
European Union, adopt the necessary practical arrangements.
B. WEU's relations with the Atlantic Alliance
4. The objective is to develop WEU as a means to strengthen the
European pillar of the Atlantic Alliance. Accordingly WEU is prepared
to develop further the close working links between WEU and the
Alliance and to strengthen the role, responsibilities and contributions
of WEU Member States in the Alliance. This will be undertaken on the
basis of the necessary transparency and complementarity between
the emerging European security and defence identity and the Alliance.
WEU will act in conformity with the positions adopted in the Atlantic
Alliance.
- WEU Member States will intensify their co-ordination on Alliance
issues which represent an important common interest with the aim of
introducing joint positions agreed in WEU into the process of
consultation in the Alliance which will remain the essential forum for
consultation among its members and the venue for agreement on
policies bearing on the security and defence commitments of Allies
under the North Atlantic Treaty.
- Where necessary, dates and venues of meetings will be
synchronized and working methods harmonized.
- Close co-operation will be established between the Secretariats-
General of WEU and NATO.
C. Operational role of WEU
5. WEU's operational role will be strengthened by examining and
defining appropriate missions, structures and means, covering in
particular:
-WEU planning cell;
- closer military co-operation complementary to the Alliance in
particular in the fields of logistics, transport, training and strategic
surveillance;
- meetings of WEU Chiefs of Defence Staff;
- military units answerable to WEU.
Other proposals will be examined further including:
- enhanced co-operation in the field of armaments with the aim of
creating a European armaments agency;
-development of the WEU Institute into a European Security and
Defence Academy.
Arrangements aimed at giving WEU a stronger operational role will be
fully compatible with the military dispositions necessary to ensure the
collective defence of all Allies.
D. Other measures
6. As a consequence of the measures set out above, and in order to
facilitate the strengthening of WEU's role, the seat of the WEU Council
and Secretariat will be transferred to Brussels.
7. Representation of the WEU Council must be such that the Council is
able to exercise its functions continuously in accordance with Article
VIII of the modified Brussels Treaty. Member States may draw on a
double-hatting formula, to be worked out, consisting of their
representatives to the Alliance and to the European Union.
8. WEU notes that, in accordance with the provisions of Article J.4(6)
concerning the common foreign and security policy of the Treaty on
European Union, the Union will decide to review the provisions of this
Article with a view to furthering the objective to be set by it in
accordance with the procedure defined. The WEU will re-examine the
present provisions in 1996. This re-examination will take account of
the progress and experience acquired and will extend to relations
between WEU and the Atlantic Alliance.
II. DECLARATION
by Belgium, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Portugal and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland which are members of the Western European Union.
"The Member States of WEU welcome the development of the
European security and defence identity. They are determined, taking
into account the role of WEU as the defence component of the
European Union and as the means to strengthen the European pillar of
the Atlantic Alliance, to put the relationship between WEU and the
other European States on a new basis for the sake of stability and
security in Europe. In this spirit, they propose the following:
States which are members of the European Union are invited to
accede to WEU on conditions to be agreed in accordance with Article
XI of the modified Brussels Treaty, or to become observers if they so
wish. Simultaneously, other European Member States of NATO are
invited to become associate members of WEU in a way which will give
them the possibility of participating fully in the activities of WEU.
The Member States of WEU assume that treaties and agreements
corresponding with the above proposals will be concluded before 31
December 1992."
DECLARATION
ON ASYLUM
1. The Conference agrees that, in the context of the proceedings
provided for in Articles K.1 and K.3 of the provisions on co-operation in
the fields of justice and home affairs, the Council will consider as a
matter of priority questions concerning Member States' asylum
policies, with the aim of adoption by the beginning of 1993, common
action to harmonize aspects of them, in the light of the work
programme and timetable contained in the report on asylum drawn up
at the request of the European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 28
and 29 June 1991.
2. In this connection, the Council will also consider, by the end of
1993, on the basis of a report, the possibility of applying Article K.9 to
such matters.
DECLARATION
ON POLICE CO-OPERATION
The Conference confirms the agreement of the Member States on the
objectives underlying the German delegations's proposals at the
European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 28 and 29 June 1991.
For the present, the Member States agree to examine as a matter of
priority the drafts submitted to them, on the basis of the work
programme and timetable agreed upon in the report drawn up at the
request of the Luxembourg European Council, and they are willing to
envisage the adoption of practical measures in areas such as those
suggested by the German delegation, relating to the following
functions in the exchange of information and experience:
- support for national criminal investigation and security authorities, in
particular in the co-ordination of investigations and search operations;
- creation of data bases;
- central analysis and assessment of information in order to take stock
of the situation and identify investigative approaches;
- collection and analysis of national prevention programmes for
forwarding to Member States and for drawing up Europe-wide
prevention strategies;
- measures relating to further training, research, forensic matters and
criminal records departments.
Member States agree to consider on the basis of a report, during 1994
at the latest, whether the scope of such co-operation should be
extended.
DECLARATION
ON DISPUTES BETWEEN THE ECB AND THE EMI AND THEIR
SERVANTS
The Conference considers it proper that the Court of First Instance
should hear this class of action in accordance with Article 168a of the
Treaty establishing the European Community. The Conference
therefore invites the institutions to adapt the relevant rules
accordingly.

MAY1_92
On 1 May 1992, in Guimaraes (Portugal), the High Contracting Parties
to the Treaty on European Union adopted the following Declaration:


DECLARATION OF THE HIGH CONTRACTING PARTIES TO THE TREATY
ON EUROPEAN UNION

The High Contracting Parties to the Treaty on European Union signed
at Maastricht on the seventh day of February 1992,
Having considered the terms of Protocol No 17 to the said Treaty on
European Union which is annexed to that Treaty and to the Treaties
establishing the European Communities, Hereby give the following
legal interpretation:

That it was and is their intention that the Protocol shall not limit
freedom to travel between Member States or, in accordance with
conditions which may be laid down, in conformity with Community law,
by Irish legislation, to obtain or make available in Ireland information
relating to services lawfully available in Member States.

At the same time the High Contracting Parties solemly declare that, in
the event of a future constitutional amendment in Ireland which
concerns the subject matter of Article 40.3.3. of the Constitution of
Ireland and which does not conflict with the intention of the High
Contracting Parties hereinbefore expressed, they will, following the
entry into force of the Treaty on European Union, be favourably
disposed to amending the said Protocol so as to extend its application
to such constitutional amendment if Ireland so requests.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
