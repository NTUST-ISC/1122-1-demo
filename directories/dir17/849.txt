PREFACE

One or two friends to whom I showed these papers in MS. having observed
that they were not half bad, and some of my relations having promised to
buy the book if it ever came out, I feel I have no right to longer delay
its issue. But for this, as one may say, public demand, I perhaps should
not have ventured to offer these mere "idle thoughts" of mine as mental
food for the English-speaking peoples of the earth. What readers ask
nowadays in a book is that it should improve, instruct, and elevate.
This book wouldn't elevate a cow. I cannot conscientiously recommend it
for any useful purposes whatever. All I can suggest is that when you get
tired of reading "the best hundred books," you may take this up for half
an hour. It will be a change.

THE IDLE THOUGHTS OF AN IDLE FELLOW.




ON BEING IDLE.

Now, this is a subject on which I flatter myself I really am _au fait_.
The gentleman who, when I was young, bathed me at wisdom's font for nine
guineas a term--no extras--used to say he never knew a boy who could
do less work in more time; and I remember my poor grandmother once
incidentally observing, in the course of an instruction upon the use
of the Prayer-book, that it was highly improbable that I should ever do
much that I ought not to do, but that she felt convinced beyond a doubt
that I should leave undone pretty well everything that I ought to do.

I am afraid I have somewhat belied half the dear old lady's prophecy.
Heaven help me! I have done a good many things that I ought not to have
done, in spite of my laziness. But I have fully confirmed the accuracy
of her judgment so far as neglecting much that I ought not to have
neglected is concerned. Idling always has been my strong point. I take
no credit to myself in the matter--it is a gift. Few possess it. There
are plenty of lazy people and plenty of slow-coaches, but a genuine
idler is a rarity. He is not a man who slouches about with his hands in
his pockets. On the contrary, his most startling characteristic is that
he is always intensely busy.

It is impossible to enjoy idling thoroughly unless one has plenty of
work to do. There is no fun in doing nothing when you have nothing to
do. Wasting time is merely an occupation then, and a most exhausting
one. Idleness, like kisses, to be sweet must be stolen.

Many years ago, when I was a young man, I was taken very ill--I never
could see myself that much was the matter with me, except that I had
a beastly cold. But I suppose it was something very serious, for the
doctor said that I ought to have come to him a month before, and that
if it (whatever it was) had gone on for another week he would not have
answered for the consequences. It is an extraordinary thing, but I
never knew a doctor called into any case yet but what it transpired
that another day's delay would have rendered cure hopeless. Our medical
guide, philosopher, and friend is like the hero in a melodrama--he
always comes upon the scene just, and only just, in the nick of time. It
is Providence, that is what it is.

Well, as I was saying, I was very ill and was ordered to Buxton for a
month, with strict injunctions to do nothing whatever all the while
that I was there. "Rest is what you require," said the doctor, "perfect
rest."

It seemed a delightful prospect. "This man evidently understands my
complaint," said I, and I pictured to myself a glorious time--a four
weeks' _dolce far niente_ with a dash of illness in it. Not too much
illness, but just illness enough--just sufficient to give it the flavor
of suffering and make it poetical. I should get up late, sip chocolate,
and have my breakfast in slippers and a dressing-gown. I should lie out
in the garden in a hammock and read sentimental novels with a melancholy
ending, until the books should fall from my listless hand, and I should
recline there, dreamily gazing into the deep blue of the firmament,
watching the fleecy clouds floating like white-sailed ships across
its depths, and listening to the joyous song of the birds and the low
rustling of the trees. Or, on becoming too weak to go out of doors,
I should sit propped up with pillows at the open window of the
ground-floor front, and look wasted and interesting, so that all the
pretty girls would sigh as they passed by.

And twice a day I should go down in a Bath chair to the Colonnade to
drink the waters. Oh, those waters! I knew nothing about them then,
and was rather taken with the idea. "Drinking the waters" sounded
fashionable and Queen Anne-fied, and I thought I should like them. But,
ugh! after the first three or four mornings! Sam Weller's description of
them as "having a taste of warm flat-irons" conveys only a faint idea of
their hideous nauseousness. If anything could make a sick man get well
quickly, it would be the knowledge that he must drink a glassful of them
every day until he was recovered. I drank them neat for six consecutive
days, and they nearly killed me; but after then I adopted the plan of
taking a stiff glass of brandy-and-water immediately on the top of them,
and found much relief thereby. I have been informed since, by various
eminent medical gentlemen, that the alcohol must have entirely
counteracted the effects of the chalybeate properties contained in the
water. I am glad I was lucky enough to hit upon the right thing.

But "drinking the waters" was only a small portion of the torture I
experienced during that memorable month--a month which was, without
exception, the most miserable I have ever spent. During the best part of
it I religiously followed the doctor's mandate and did nothing whatever,
except moon about the house and garden and go out for two hours a day in
a Bath chair. That did break the monotony to a certain extent. There is
more excitement about Bath-chairing--especially if you are not used to
the exhilarating exercise--than might appear to the casual observer. A
sense of danger, such as a mere outsider might not understand, is ever
present to the mind of the occupant. He feels convinced every minute
that the whole concern is going over, a conviction which becomes
especially lively whenever a ditch or a stretch of newly macadamized
road comes in sight. Every vehicle that passes he expects is going to
run into him; and he never finds himself ascending or descending a
hill without immediately beginning to speculate upon his chances,
supposing--as seems extremely probable--that the weak-kneed controller
of his destiny should let go.

But even this diversion failed to enliven after awhile, and the _ennui_
became perfectly unbearable. I felt my mind giving way under it. It is
not a strong mind, and I thought it would be unwise to tax it too far.
So somewhere about the twentieth morning I got up early, had a good
breakfast, and walked straight off to Hayfield, at the foot of the
Kinder Scout--a pleasant, busy little town, reached through a lovely
valley, and with two sweetly pretty women in it. At least they were
sweetly pretty then; one passed me on the bridge and, I think, smiled;
and the other was standing at an open door, making an unremunerative
investment of kisses upon a red-faced baby. But it is years ago, and I
dare say they have both grown stout and snappish since that time.
Coming back, I saw an old man breaking stones, and it roused such strong
longing in me to use my arms that I offered him a drink to let me take
his place. He was a kindly old man and he humored me. I went for those
stones with the accumulated energy of three weeks, and did more work in
half an hour than he had done all day. But it did not make him jealous.

Having taken the plunge, I went further and further into dissipation,
going out for a long walk every morning and listening to the band in
the pavilion every evening. But the days still passed slowly
notwithstanding, and I was heartily glad when the last one came and I
was being whirled away from gouty, consumptive Buxton to London with its
stern work and life. I looked out of the carriage as we rushed through
Hendon in the evening. The lurid glare overhanging the mighty city
seemed to warm my heart, and when, later on, my cab rattled out of St.
Pancras' station, the old familiar roar that came swelling up around me
sounded the sweetest music I had heard for many a long day.

I certainly did not enjoy that month's idling. I like idling when I
ought not to be idling; not when it is the only thing I have to do. That
is my pig-headed nature. The time when I like best to stand with my
back to the fire, calculating how much I owe, is when my desk is heaped
highest with letters that must be answered by the next post. When I like
to dawdle longest over my dinner is when I have a heavy evening's work
before me. And if, for some urgent reason, I ought to be up particularly
early in the morning, it is then, more than at any other time, that I
love to lie an extra half-hour in bed.

Ah! how delicious it is to turn over and go to sleep again: "just for
five minutes." Is there any human being, I wonder, besides the hero of
a Sunday-school "tale for boys," who ever gets up willingly? There
are some men to whom getting up at the proper time is an utter
impossibility. If eight o'clock happens to be the time that they should
turn out, then they lie till half-past. If circumstances change and
half-past eight becomes early enough for them, then it is nine before
they can rise. They are like the statesman of whom it was said that he
was always punctually half an hour late. They try all manner of schemes.
They buy alarm-clocks (artful contrivances that go off at the wrong time
and alarm the wrong people). They tell Sarah Jane to knock at the door
and call them, and Sarah Jane does knock at the door and does call them,
and they grunt back "awri" and then go comfortably to sleep again. I
knew one man who would actually get out and have a cold bath; and even
that was of no use, for afterward he would jump into bed again to warm
himself.

I think myself that I could keep out of bed all right if I once got
out. It is the wrenching away of the head from the pillow that I find so
hard, and no amount of over-night determination makes it easier. I say
to myself, after having wasted the whole evening, "Well, I won't do
any more work to-night; I'll get up early to-morrow morning;" and I am
thoroughly resolved to do so--then. In the morning, however, I feel less
enthusiastic about the idea, and reflect that it would have been much
better if I had stopped up last night. And then there is the trouble of
dressing, and the more one thinks about that the more one wants to put
it off.

It is a strange thing this bed, this mimic grave, where we stretch our
tired limbs and sink away so quietly into the silence and rest. "O bed,
O bed, delicious bed, that heaven on earth to the weary head," as sang
poor Hood, you are a kind old nurse to us fretful boys and girls. Clever
and foolish, naughty and good, you take us all in your motherly lap and
hush our wayward crying. The strong man full of care--the sick man
full of pain--the little maiden sobbing for her faithless lover--like
children we lay our aching heads on your white bosom, and you gently
soothe us off to by-by.

Our trouble is sore indeed when you turn away and will not comfort us.
How long the dawn seems coming when we cannot sleep! Oh! those hideous
nights when we toss and turn in fever and pain, when we lie, like living
men among the dead, staring out into the dark hours that drift so slowly
between us and the light. And oh! those still more hideous nights when
we sit by another in pain, when the low fire startles us every now and
then with a falling cinder, and the tick of the clock seems a hammer
beating out the life that we are watching.

But enough of beds and bedrooms. I have kept to them too long, even for
an idle fellow. Let us come out and have a smoke. That wastes time just
as well and does not look so bad. Tobacco has been a blessing to us
idlers. What the civil-service clerk before Sir Walter's time found
to occupy their minds with it is hard to imagine. I attribute the
quarrelsome nature of the Middle Ages young men entirely to the want of
the soothing weed. They had no work to do and could not smoke, and
the consequence was they were forever fighting and rowing. If, by any
extraordinary chance, there was no war going, then they got up a deadly
family feud with the next-door neighbor, and if, in spite of this, they
still had a few spare moments on their hands, they occupied them with
discussions as to whose sweetheart was the best looking, the arguments
employed on both sides being battle-axes, clubs, etc. Questions of taste
were soon decided in those days. When a twelfth-century youth fell in
love he did not take three paces backward, gaze into her eyes, and tell
her she was too beautiful to live. He said he would step outside and see
about it. And if, when he got out, he met a man and broke his head--the
other man's head, I mean--then that proved that his--the first
fellow's--girl was a pretty girl. But if the other fellow broke _his_
head--not his own, you know, but the other fellow's--the other fellow
to the second fellow, that is, because of course the other fellow would
only be the other fellow to him, not the first fellow who--well, if he
broke his head, then _his_ girl--not the other fellow's, but the fellow
who _was_ the--Look here, if A broke B's head, then A's girl was a
pretty girl; but if B broke A's head, then A's girl wasn't a pretty
girl, but B's girl was. That was their method of conducting art
criticism.

Nowadays we light a pipe and let the girls fight it out among
themselves.

They do it very well. They are getting to do all our work. They are
doctors, and barristers, and artists. They manage theaters, and promote
swindles, and edit newspapers. I am looking forward to the time when we
men shall have nothing to do but lie in bed till twelve, read two novels
a day, have nice little five-o'clock teas all to ourselves, and tax
our brains with nothing more trying than discussions upon the latest
patterns in trousers and arguments as to what Mr. Jones' coat was
made of and whether it fitted him. It is a glorious prospect--for idle
fellows.




ON BEING IN LOVE.

You've been in love, of course! If not you've got it to come. Love is
like the measles; we all have to go through it. Also like the measles,
we take it only once. One never need be afraid of catching it a second
time. The man who has had it can go into the most dangerous places and
play the most foolhardy tricks with perfect safety. He can picnic in
shady woods, ramble through leafy aisles, and linger on mossy seats to
watch the sunset. He fears a quiet country-house no more than he would
his own club. He can join a family party to go down the Rhine. He can,
to see the last of a friend, venture into the very jaws of the marriage
ceremony itself. He can keep his head through the whirl of a ravishing
waltz, and rest afterward in a dark conservatory, catching nothing more
lasting than a cold. He can brave a moonlight walk adown sweet-scented
lanes or a twilight pull among the somber rushes. He can get over a
stile without danger, scramble through a tangled hedge without being
caught, come down a slippery path without falling. He can look into
sunny eyes and not be dazzled. He listens to the siren voices, yet sails
on with unveered helm. He clasps white hands in his, but no electric
"Lulu"-like force holds him bound in their dainty pressure.

No, we never sicken with love twice. Cupid spends no second arrow on
the same heart. Love's handmaids are our life-long friends. Respect, and
admiration, and affection, our doors may always be left open for, but
their great celestial master, in his royal progress, pays but one visit
and departs. We like, we cherish, we are very, very fond of--but we
never love again. A man's heart is a firework that once in its time
flashes heavenward. Meteor-like, it blazes for a moment and lights
with its glory the whole world beneath. Then the night of our sordid
commonplace life closes in around it, and the burned-out case, falling
back to earth, lies useless and uncared for, slowly smoldering into
ashes. Once, breaking loose from our prison bonds, we dare, as mighty
old Prometheus dared, to scale the Olympian mount and snatch from
Phoebus' chariot the fire of the gods. Happy those who, hastening down
again ere it dies out, can kindle their earthly altars at its flame.
Love is too pure a light to burn long among the noisome gases that we
breathe, but before it is choked out we may use it as a torch to ignite
the cozy fire of affection.

And, after all, that warming glow is more suited to our cold little back
parlor of a world than is the burning spirit love. Love should be the
vestal fire of some mighty temple--some vast dim fane whose organ music
is the rolling of the spheres. Affection will burn cheerily when the
white flame of love is flickered out. Affection is a fire that can be
fed from day to day and be piled up ever higher as the wintry years draw
nigh. Old men and women can sit by it with their thin hands clasped, the
little children can nestle down in front, the friend and neighbor has
his welcome corner by its side, and even shaggy Fido and sleek Titty can
toast their noses at the bars.

Let us heap the coals of kindness upon that fire. Throw on your pleasant
words, your gentle pressures of the hand, your thoughtful and unselfish
deeds. Fan it with good-humor, patience, and forbearance. You can let
the wind blow and the rain fall unheeded then, for your hearth will be
warm and bright, and the faces round it will make sunshine in spite of
the clouds without.

I am afraid, dear Edwin and Angelina, you expect too much from love.
You think there is enough of your little hearts to feed this fierce,
devouring passion for all your long lives. Ah, young folk! don't rely
too much upon that unsteady flicker. It will dwindle and dwindle as the
months roll on, and there is no replenishing the fuel. You will watch it
die out in anger and disappointment. To each it will seem that it is the
other who is growing colder. Edwin sees with bitterness that Angelina no
longer runs to the gate to meet him, all smiles and blushes; and when he
has a cough now she doesn't begin to cry and, putting her arms round his
neck, say that she cannot live without him. The most she will probably
do is to suggest a lozenge, and even that in a tone implying that it is
the noise more than anything else she is anxious to get rid of.

Poor little Angelina, too, sheds silent tears, for Edwin has given up
carrying her old handkerchief in the inside pocket of his waistcoat.

Both are astonished at the falling off in the other one, but neither
sees their own change. If they did they would not suffer as they do.
They would look for the cause in the right quarter--in the littleness
of poor human nature--join hands over their common failing, and start
building their house anew on a more earthly and enduring foundation.
But we are so blind to our own shortcomings, so wide awake to those
of others. Everything that happens to us is always the other person's
fault. Angelina would have gone on loving Edwin forever and ever and
ever if only Edwin had not grown so strange and different. Edwin would
have adored Angelina through eternity if Angelina had only remained the
same as when he first adored her.

It is a cheerless hour for you both when the lamp of love has gone out
and the fire of affection is not yet lit, and you have to grope about
in the cold, raw dawn of life to kindle it. God grant it catches light
before the day is too far spent. Many sit shivering by the dead coals
till night come.

But, there, of what use is it to preach? Who that feels the rush of
young love through his veins can think it will ever flow feeble and
slow! To the boy of twenty it seems impossible that he will not love as
wildly at sixty as he does then. He cannot call to mind any middle-aged
or elderly gentleman of his acquaintance who is known to exhibit
symptoms of frantic attachment, but that does not interfere in his
belief in himself. His love will never fall, whoever else's may. Nobody
ever loved as he loves, and so, of course, the rest of the world's
experience can be no guide in his case. Alas! alas! ere thirty he has
joined the ranks of the sneerers. It is not his fault. Our passions,
both the good and bad, cease with our blushes. We do not hate, nor
grieve, nor joy, nor despair in our thirties like we did in our teens.
Disappointment does not suggest suicide, and we quaff success without
intoxication.

We take all things in a minor key as we grow older. There are few
majestic passages in the later acts of life's opera. Ambition takes
a less ambitious aim. Honor becomes more reasonable and conveniently
adapts itself to circumstances. And love--love dies. "Irreverence for
the dreams of youth" soon creeps like a killing frost upon our hearts.
The tender shoots and the expanding flowers are nipped and withered, and
of a vine that yearned to stretch its tendrils round the world there is
left but a sapless stump.

My fair friends will deem all this rank heresy, I know. So far from a
man's not loving after he has passed boyhood, it is not till there is a
good deal of gray in his hair that they think his protestations at all
worthy of attention. Young ladies take their notions of our sex from the
novels written by their own, and compared with the monstrosities
that masquerade for men in the pages of that nightmare literature,
Pythagoras' plucked bird and Frankenstein's demon were fair average
specimens of humanity.

In these so-called books, the chief lover, or Greek god, as he is
admiringly referred to--by the way, they do not say which "Greek god"
it is that the gentleman bears such a striking likeness to; it might be
hump-backed Vulcan, or double-faced Janus, or even driveling Silenus,
the god of abstruse mysteries. He resembles the whole family of them,
however, in being a blackguard, and perhaps this is what is meant. To
even the little manliness his classical prototypes possessed, though,
he can lay no claim whatever, being a listless effeminate noodle, on
the shady side of forty. But oh! the depth and strength of this elderly
party's emotion for some bread-and-butter school-girl! Hide your heads,
ye young Romeos and Leanders! this _blase_ old beau loves with an
hysterical fervor that requires four adjectives to every noun to
properly describe.

It is well, dear ladies, for us old sinners that you study only books.
Did you read mankind, you would know that the lad's shy stammering tells
a truer tale than our bold eloquence. A boy's love comes from a full
heart; a man's is more often the result of a full stomach. Indeed, a
man's sluggish current may not be called love, compared with the rushing
fountain that wells up when a boy's heart is struck with the heavenly
rod. If you would taste love, drink of the pure stream that youth pours
out at your feet. Do not wait till it has become a muddy river before
you stoop to catch its waves.

Or is it that you like its bitter flavor--that the clear, limpid water
is insipid to your palate and that the pollution of its after-course
gives it a relish to your lips? Must we believe those who tell us that a
hand foul with the filth of a shameful life is the only one a young girl
cares to be caressed by?

That is the teaching that is bawled out day by day from between those
yellow covers. Do they ever pause to think, I wonder, those devil's
ladyhelps, what mischief they are doing crawling about God's garden, and
telling childish Eves and silly Adams that sin is sweet and that decency
is ridiculous and vulgar? How many an innocent girl do they not degrade
into an evil-minded woman? To how many a weak lad do they not point out
the dirty by-path as the shortest cut to a maiden's heart? It is not as
if they wrote of life as it really is. Speak truth, and right will take
care of itself. But their pictures are coarse daubs painted from the
sickly fancies of their own diseased imagination.

We want to think of women not--as their own sex would show them--as
Lorleis luring us to destruction, but as good angels beckoning us
upward. They have more power for good or evil than they dream of. It is
just at the very age when a man's character is forming that he tumbles
into love, and then the lass he loves has the making or marring of him.
Unconsciously he molds himself to what she would have him, good or bad.
I am sorry to have to be ungallant enough to say that I do not think
they always use their influence for the best. Too often the female world
is bounded hard and fast within the limits of the commonplace. Their
ideal hero is a prince of littleness, and to become that many a powerful
mind, enchanted by love, is "lost to life and use and name and fame."

And yet, women, you could make us so much better if you only would. It
rests with you, more than with all the preachers, to roll this world a
little nearer heaven. Chivalry is not dead: it only sleeps for want
of work to do. It is you who must wake it to noble deeds. You must be
worthy of knightly worship.

You must be higher than ourselves. It was for Una that the Red Cross
Knight did war. For no painted, mincing court dame could the dragon have
been slain. Oh, ladies fair, be fair in mind and soul as well as face,
so that brave knights may win glory in your service! Oh, woman, throw
off your disguising cloaks of selfishness, effrontery, and affectation!
Stand forth once more a queen in your royal robe of simple purity. A
thousand swords, now rusting in ignoble sloth, shall leap from their
scabbards to do battle for your honor against wrong. A thousand Sir
Rolands shall lay lance in rest, and Fear, Avarice, Pleasure, and
Ambition shall go down in the dust before your colors.

What noble deeds were we not ripe for in the days when we loved?
What noble lives could we not have lived for her sake? Our love was
a religion we could have died for. It was no mere human creature like
ourselves that we adored. It was a queen that we paid homage to, a
goddess that we worshiped.

And how madly we did worship! And how sweet it was to worship! Ah, lad,
cherish love's young dream while it lasts! You will know too soon how
truly little Tom Moore sang when he said that there was nothing half so
sweet in life. Even when it brings misery it is a wild, romantic misery,
all unlike the dull, worldly pain of after-sorrows. When you have lost
her--when the light is gone out from your life and the world stretches
before you a long, dark horror, even then a half-enchantment mingles
with your despair.

And who would not risk its terrors to gain its raptures? Ah, what
raptures they were! The mere recollection thrills you. How delicious
it was to tell her that you loved her, that you lived for her, that
you would die for her! How you did rave, to be sure, what floods of
extravagant nonsense you poured forth, and oh, how cruel it was of
her to pretend not to believe you! In what awe you stood of her! How
miserable you were when you had offended her! And yet, how pleasant to
be bullied by her and to sue for pardon without having the slightest
notion of what your fault was! How dark the world was when she snubbed
you, as she often did, the little rogue, just to see you look wretched;
how sunny when she smiled! How jealous you were of every one about
her! How you hated every man she shook hands with, every woman she
kissed--the maid that did her hair, the boy that cleaned her shoes, the
dog she nursed--though you had to be respectful to the last-named! How
you looked forward to seeing her, how stupid you were when you did see
her, staring at her without saying a word! How impossible it was for
you to go out at any time of the day or night without finding yourself
eventually opposite her windows! You hadn't pluck enough to go in, but
you hung about the corner and gazed at the outside. Oh, if the house had
only caught fire--it was insured, so it wouldn't have mattered--and you
could have rushed in and saved her at the risk of your life, and have
been terribly burned and injured! Anything to serve her. Even in little
things that was so sweet. How you would watch her, spaniel-like, to
anticipate her slightest wish! How proud you were to do her bidding! How
delightful it was to be ordered about by her! To devote your whole life
to her and to never think of yourself seemed such a simple thing. You
would go without a holiday to lay a humble offering at her shrine, and
felt more than repaid if she only deigned to accept it. How precious to
you was everything that she had hallowed by her touch--her little glove,
the ribbon she had worn, the rose that had nestled in her hair and whose
withered leaves still mark the poems you never care to look at now.

And oh, how beautiful she was, how wondrous beautiful! It was as some
angel entering the room, and all else became plain and earthly. She was
too sacred to be touched. It seemed almost presumption to gaze at her.
You would as soon have thought of kissing her as of singing comic songs
in a cathedral. It was desecration enough to kneel and timidly raise the
gracious little hand to your lips.

Ah, those foolish days, those foolish days when we were unselfish and
pure-minded; those foolish days when our simple hearts were full
of truth, and faith, and reverence! Ah, those foolish days of noble
longings and of noble strivings! And oh, these wise, clever days when we
know that money is the only prize worth striving for, when we believe in
nothing else but meanness and lies, when we care for no living creature
but ourselves!




ON BEING IN THE BLUES.

I can enjoy feeling melancholy, and there is a good deal of satisfaction
about being thoroughly miserable; but nobody likes a fit of the blues.
Nevertheless, everybody has them; notwithstanding which, nobody can tell
why. There is no accounting for them. You are just as likely to have one
on the day after you have come into a large fortune as on the day after
you have left your new silk umbrella in the train. Its effect upon you
is somewhat similar to what would probably be produced by a combined
attack of toothache, indigestion, and cold in the head. You become
stupid, restless, and irritable; rude to strangers and dangerous toward
your friends; clumsy, maudlin, and quarrelsome; a nuisance to yourself
and everybody about you.

While it is on you can do nothing and think of nothing, though feeling
at the time bound to do something. You can't sit still so put on your
hat and go for a walk; but before you get to the corner of the street
you wish you hadn't come out and you turn back. You open a book and try
to read, but you find Shakespeare trite and commonplace, Dickens is dull
and prosy, Thackeray a bore, and Carlyle too sentimental. You throw the
book aside and call the author names. Then you "shoo" the cat out of
the room and kick the door to after her. You think you will write your
letters, but after sticking at "Dearest Auntie: I find I have five
minutes to spare, and so hasten to write to you," for a quarter of an
hour, without being able to think of another sentence, you tumble the
paper into the desk, fling the wet pen down upon the table-cloth,
and start up with the resolution of going to see the Thompsons. While
pulling on your gloves, however, it occurs to you that the Thompsons are
idiots; that they never have supper; and that you will be expected to
jump the baby. You curse the Thompsons and decide not to go.

By this time you feel completely crushed. You bury your face in your
hands and think you would like to die and go to heaven. You picture to
yourself your own sick-bed, with all your friends and relations standing
round you weeping. You bless them all, especially the young and pretty
ones. They will value you when you are gone, so you say to yourself,
and learn too late what they have lost; and you bitterly contrast their
presumed regard for you then with their decided want of veneration now.

These reflections make you feel a little more cheerful, but only for a
brief period; for the next moment you think what a fool you must be
to imagine for an instant that anybody would be sorry at anything that
might happen to you. Who would care two straws (whatever precise amount
of care two straws may represent) whether you are blown up, or hung
up, or married, or drowned? Nobody cares for you. You never have
been properly appreciated, never met with your due deserts in any one
particular. You review the whole of your past life, and it is painfully
apparent that you have been ill-used from your cradle.

Half an hour's indulgence in these considerations works you up into
a state of savage fury against everybody and everything, especially
yourself, whom anatomical reasons alone prevent your kicking. Bed-time
at last comes, to save you from doing something rash, and you spring
upstairs, throw off your clothes, leaving them strewn all over the room,
blow out the candle, and jump into bed as if you had backed yourself
for a heavy wager to do the whole thing against time. There you toss
and tumble about for a couple of hours or so, varying the monotony by
occasionally jerking the clothes off and getting out and putting them
on again. At length you drop into an uneasy and fitful slumber, have bad
dreams, and wake up late the next morning.

At least, this is all we poor single men can do under the circumstances.
Married men bully their wives, grumble at the dinner, and insist on the
children's going to bed. All of which, creating, as it does, a good deal
of disturbance in the house, must be a great relief to the feelings of a
man in the blues, rows being the only form of amusement in which he can
take any interest.

The symptoms of the infirmity are much the same in every case, but the
affliction itself is variously termed. The poet says that "a feeling
of sadness comes o'er him." 'Arry refers to the heavings of his wayward
heart by confiding to Jimee that he has "got the blooming hump." Your
sister doesn't know what is the matter with her to-night. She feels out
of sorts altogether and hopes nothing is going to happen. The every-day
young man is "so awful glad to meet you, old fellow," for he does "feel
so jolly miserable this evening." As for myself, I generally say that "I
have a strange, unsettled feeling to-night" and "think I'll go out."

By the way, it never does come except in the evening. In the sun-time,
when the world is bounding forward full of life, we cannot stay to sigh
and sulk. The roar of the working day drowns the voices of the elfin
sprites that are ever singing their low-toned _miserere_ in our ears.
In the day we are angry, disappointed, or indignant, but never "in the
blues" and never melancholy. When things go wrong at ten o'clock in the
morning we--or rather you--swear and knock the furniture about; but if
the misfortune comes at ten P.M., we read poetry or sit in the dark and
think what a hollow world this is.

But, as a rule, it is not trouble that makes us melancholy. The
actuality is too stern a thing for sentiment. We linger to weep over
a picture, but from the original we should quickly turn our eyes away.
There is no pathos in real misery: no luxury in real grief. We do not
toy with sharp swords nor hug a gnawing fox to our breast for choice.
When a man or woman loves to brood over a sorrow and takes care to keep
it green in their memory, you may be sure it is no longer a pain to
them. However they may have suffered from it at first, the recollection
has become by then a pleasure. Many dear old ladies who daily look at
tiny shoes lying in lavender-scented drawers, and weep as they think of
the tiny feet whose toddling march is done, and sweet-faced young ones
who place each night beneath their pillow some lock that once curled on
a boyish head that the salt waves have kissed to death, will call me
a nasty cynical brute and say I'm talking nonsense; but I believe,
nevertheless, that if they will ask themselves truthfully whether they
find it unpleasant to dwell thus on their sorrow, they will be compelled
to answer "No." Tears are as sweet as laughter to some natures. The
proverbial Englishman, we know from old chronicler Froissart, takes his
pleasures sadly, and the Englishwoman goes a step further and takes her
pleasures in sadness itself.

I am not sneering. I would not for a moment sneer at anything that
helps to keep hearts tender in this hard old world. We men are cold and
common-sensed enough for all; we would not have women the same. No, no,
ladies dear, be always sentimental and soft-hearted, as you are--be the
soothing butter to our coarse dry bread. Besides, sentiment is to women
what fun is to us. They do not care for our humor, surely it would be
unfair to deny them their grief. And who shall say that their mode of
enjoyment is not as sensible as ours? Why assume that a doubled-up
body, a contorted, purple face, and a gaping mouth emitting a series
of ear-splitting shrieks point to a state of more intelligent happiness
than a pensive face reposing upon a little white hand, and a pair of
gentle tear-dimmed eyes looking back through Time's dark avenue upon a
fading past?

I am glad when I see Regret walked with as a friend--glad because I know
the saltness has been washed from out the tears, and that the sting must
have been plucked from the beautiful face of Sorrow ere we dare press
her pale lips to ours. Time has laid his healing hand upon the wound
when we can look back upon the pain we once fainted under and no
bitterness or despair rises in our hearts. The burden is no longer
heavy when we have for our past troubles only the same sweet mingling of
pleasure and pity that we feel when old knight-hearted Colonel Newcome
answers "_adsum_" to the great roll-call, or when Tom and Maggie
Tulliver, clasping hands through the mists that have divided them, go
down, locked in each other's arms, beneath the swollen waters of the
Floss.

Talking of poor Tom and Maggie Tulliver brings to my mind a saying of
George Eliot's in connection with this subject of melancholy. She
speaks somewhere of the "sadness of a summer's evening." How wonderfully
true--like everything that came from that wonderful pen--the observation
is! Who has not felt the sorrowful enchantment of those lingering
sunsets? The world belongs to Melancholy then, a thoughtful deep-eyed
maiden who loves not the glare of day. It is not till "light thickens
and the crow wings to the rocky wood" that she steals forth from her
groves. Her palace is in twilight land. It is there she meets us. At her
shadowy gate she takes our hand in hers and walks beside us through
her mystic realm. We see no form, but seem to hear the rustling of her
wings.

Even in the toiling hum-drum city her spirit comes to us. There is a
somber presence in each long, dull street; and the dark river creeps
ghostlike under the black arches, as if bearing some hidden secret
beneath its muddy waves.

In the silent country, when the trees and hedges loom dim and blurred
against the rising night, and the bat's wing flutters in our face, and
the land-rail's cry sounds drearily across the fields, the spell sinks
deeper still into our hearts. We seem in that hour to be standing by
some unseen death-bed, and in the swaying of the elms we hear the sigh
of the dying day.

A solemn sadness reigns. A great peace is around us. In its light
our cares of the working day grow small and trivial, and bread and
cheese--ay, and even kisses--do not seem the only things worth striving
for. Thoughts we cannot speak but only listen to flood in upon us, and
standing in the stillness under earth's darkening dome, we feel that we
are greater than our petty lives. Hung round with those dusky curtains,
the world is no longer a mere dingy workshop, but a stately temple
wherein man may worship, and where at times in the dimness his groping
hands touch God's.




ON BEING HARD UP.

It is a most remarkable thing. I sat down with the full intention of
writing something clever and original; but for the life of me I can't
think of anything clever and original--at least, not at this moment. The
only thing I can think about now is being hard up. I suppose having my
hands in my pockets has made me think about this. I always do sit with
my hands in my pockets except when I am in the company of my sisters,
my cousins, or my aunts; and they kick up such a shindy--I should say
expostulate so eloquently upon the subject--that I have to give in and
take them out--my hands I mean. The chorus to their objections is that
it is not gentlemanly. I am hanged if I can see why. I could understand
its not being considered gentlemanly to put your hands in other people's
pockets (especially by the other people), but how, O ye sticklers for
what looks this and what looks that, can putting his hands in his own
pockets make a man less gentle? Perhaps you are right, though. Now I
come to think of it, I have heard some people grumble most savagely when
doing it. But they were mostly old gentlemen. We young fellows, as a
rule, are never quite at ease unless we have our hands in our pockets.
We are awkward and shifty. We are like what a music-hall Lion Comique
would be without his opera-hat, if such a thing can be imagined. But let
us put our hands in our trousers pockets, and let there be some small
change in the right-hand one and a bunch of keys in the left, and we
will face a female post-office clerk.

It is a little difficult to know what to do with your hands, even in
your pockets, when there is nothing else there. Years ago, when my whole
capital would occasionally come down to "what in town the people call
a bob," I would recklessly spend a penny of it, merely for the sake of
having the change, all in coppers, to jingle. You don't feel nearly so
hard up with eleven pence in your pocket as you do with a shilling. Had
I been "La-di-da," that impecunious youth about whom we superior folk
are so sarcastic, I would have changed my penny for two ha'pennies.

I can speak with authority on the subject of being hard up. I have been
a provincial actor. If further evidence be required, which I do not
think likely, I can add that I have been a "gentleman connected with the
press." I have lived on 15 shilling a week. I have lived a week on 10,
owing the other 5; and I have lived for a fortnight on a great-coat.

It is wonderful what an insight into domestic economy being really hard
up gives one. If you want to find out the value of money, live on
15 shillings a week and see how much you can put by for clothes and
recreation. You will find out that it is worth while to wait for the
farthing change, that it is worth while to walk a mile to save a
penny, that a glass of beer is a luxury to be indulged in only at rare
intervals, and that a collar can be worn for four days.

Try it just before you get married. It will be excellent practice. Let
your son and heir try it before sending him to college. He won't grumble
at a hundred a year pocket-money then. There are some people to whom it
would do a world of good. There is that delicate blossom who can't drink
any claret under ninety-four, and who would as soon think of dining
off cat's meat as off plain roast mutton. You do come across these
poor wretches now and then, though, to the credit of humanity, they are
principally confined to that fearful and wonderful society known only
to lady novelists. I never hear of one of these creatures discussing a
_menu_ card but I feel a mad desire to drag him off to the bar of
some common east-end public-house and cram a sixpenny dinner down his
throat--beefsteak pudding, fourpence; potatoes, a penny; half a pint of
porter, a penny. The recollection of it (and the mingled fragrance of
beer, tobacco, and roast pork generally leaves a vivid impression) might
induce him to turn up his nose a little less frequently in the future
at everything that is put before him. Then there is that generous party,
the cadger's delight, who is so free with his small change, but who
never thinks of paying his debts. It might teach even him a little
common sense. "I always give the waiter a shilling. One can't give the
fellow less, you know," explained a young government clerk with whom I
was lunching the other day in Regent Street. I agreed with him as to the
utter impossibility of making it elevenpence ha'penny; but at the same
time I resolved to one day decoy him to an eating-house I remembered
near Covent Garden, where the waiter, for the better discharge of his
duties, goes about in his shirt-sleeves--and very dirty sleeves they
are, too, when it gets near the end of the month. I know that waiter.
If my friend gives him anything beyond a penny, the man will insist on
shaking hands with him then and there as a mark of his esteem; of that I
feel sure.

There have been a good many funny things said and written about
hardupishness, but the reality is not funny, for all that. It is not
funny to have to haggle over pennies. It isn't funny to be thought
mean and stingy. It isn't funny to be shabby and to be ashamed of your
address. No, there is nothing at all funny in poverty--to the poor. It
is hell upon earth to a sensitive man; and many a brave gentleman who
would have faced the labors of Hercules has had his heart broken by its
petty miseries.

It is not the actual discomforts themselves that are hard to bear.
Who would mind roughing it a bit if that were all it meant? What cared
Robinson Crusoe for a patch on his trousers? Did he wear trousers? I
forget; or did he go about as he does in the pantomimes? What did it
matter to him if his toes did stick out of his boots? and what if
his umbrella was a cotton one, so long as it kept the rain off? His
shabbiness did not trouble him; there was none of his friends round
about to sneer him.

Being poor is a mere trifle. It is being known to be poor that is the
sting. It is not cold that makes a man without a great-coat hurry along
so quickly. It is not all shame at telling lies--which he knows will
not be believed--that makes him turn so red when he informs you that
he considers great-coats unhealthy and never carries an umbrella on
principle. It is easy enough to say that poverty is no crime. No; if
it were men wouldn't be ashamed of it. It's a blunder, though, and is
punished as such. A poor man is despised the whole world over; despised
as much by a Christian as by a lord, as much by a demagogue as by a
footman, and not all the copy-book maxims ever set for ink stained youth
will make him respected. Appearances are everything, so far as human
opinion goes, and the man who will walk down Piccadilly arm in arm with
the most notorious scamp in London, provided he is a well-dressed one,
will slink up a back street to say a couple of words to a seedy-looking
gentleman. And the seedy-looking gentleman knows this--no one
better--and will go a mile round to avoid meeting an acquaintance. Those
that knew him in his prosperity need never trouble themselves to look
the other way. He is a thousand times more anxious that they should not
see him than they can be; and as to their assistance, there is nothing
he dreads more than the offer of it. All he wants is to be forgotten;
and in this respect he is generally fortunate enough to get what he
wants.

One becomes used to being hard up, as one becomes used to everything
else, by the help of that wonderful old homeopathic doctor, Time. You
can tell at a glance the difference between the old hand and the novice;
between the case-hardened man who has been used to shift and struggle
for years and the poor devil of a beginner striving to hide his misery,
and in a constant agony of fear lest he should be found out. Nothing
shows this difference more clearly than the way in which each will pawn
his watch. As the poet says somewhere: "True ease in pawning comes from
art, not chance." The one goes into his "uncle's" with as much composure
as he would into his tailor's--very likely with more. The assistant is
even civil and attends to him at once, to the great indignation of the
lady in the next box, who, however, sarcastically observes that she
don't mind being kept waiting "if it is a regular customer." Why, from
the pleasant and businesslike manner in which the transaction is carried
out, it might be a large purchase in the three per cents. Yet what a
piece of work a man makes of his first "pop." A boy popping his first
question is confidence itself compared with him. He hangs about outside
the shop until he has succeeded in attracting the attention of all the
loafers in the neighborhood and has aroused strong suspicions in the
mind of the policeman on the beat. At last, after a careful examination
of the contents of the windows, made for the purpose of impressing the
bystanders with the notion that he is going in to purchase a diamond
bracelet or some such trifle, he enters, trying to do so with a careless
swagger, and giving himself really the air of a member of the swell mob.
When inside he speaks in so low a voice as to be perfectly inaudible,
and has to say it all over again. When, in the course of his rambling
conversation about a "friend" of his, the word "lend" is reached, he is
promptly told to go up the court on the right and take the first door
round the corner. He comes out of the shop with a face that you could
easily light a cigarette at, and firmly under the impression that the
whole population of the district is watching him. When he does get
to the right place he has forgotten his name and address and is in a
general condition of hopeless imbecility. Asked in a severe tone how he
came by "this," he stammers and contradicts himself, and it is only a
miracle if he does not confess to having stolen it that very day. He is
thereupon informed that they don't want anything to do with his sort,
and that he had better get out of this as quickly as possible, which he
does, recollecting nothing more until he finds himself three miles off,
without the slightest knowledge how he got there.

By the way, how awkward it is, though, having to depend on public-houses
and churches for the time. The former are generally too fast and the
latter too slow. Besides which, your efforts to get a glimpse of
the public house clock from the outside are attended with great
difficulties. If you gently push the swing-door ajar and peer in you
draw upon yourself the contemptuous looks of the barmaid, who at once
puts you down in the same category with area sneaks and cadgers. You
also create a certain amount of agitation among the married portion of
the customers. You don't see the clock because it is behind the door;
and in trying to withdraw quietly you jam your head. The only other
method is to jump up and down outside the window. After this latter
proceeding, however, if you do not bring out a banjo and commence to
sing, the youthful inhabitants of the neighborhood, who have gathered
round in expectation, become disappointed.

I should like to know, too, by what mysterious law of nature it is that
before you have left your watch "to be repaired" half an hour, some one
is sure to stop you in the street and conspicuously ask you the time.
Nobody even feels the slightest curiosity on the subject when you've got
it on.

Dear old ladies and gentlemen who know nothing about being hard up--and
may they never, bless their gray old heads--look upon the pawn-shop
as the last stage of degradation; but those who know it better (and my
readers have no doubt, noticed this themselves) are often surprised,
like the little boy who dreamed he went to heaven, at meeting so many
people there that they never expected to see. For my part, I think it a
much more independent course than borrowing from friends, and I always
try to impress this upon those of my acquaintance who incline toward
"wanting a couple of pounds till the day after to-morrow." But they
won't all see it. One of them once remarked that he objected to the
principle of the thing. I fancy if he had said it was the interest that
he objected to he would have been nearer the truth: twenty-five per
cent. certainly does come heavy.

There are degrees in being hard up. We are all hard up, more or
less--most of us more. Some are hard up for a thousand pounds; some for
a shilling. Just at this moment I am hard up myself for a fiver. I only
want it for a day or two. I should be certain of paying it back within a
week at the outside, and if any lady or gentleman among my readers would
kindly lend it me, I should be very much obliged indeed. They could send
it to me under cover to Messrs. Field & Tuer, only, in such case, please
let the envelope be carefully sealed. I would give you my I.O.U. as
security.




ON VANITY AND VANITIES.

All is vanity and everybody's vain. Women are terribly vain. So are
men--more so, if possible. So are children, particularly children. One
of them at this very moment is hammering upon my legs. She wants to know
what I think of her new shoes. Candidly I don't think much of them.
They lack symmetry and curve and possess an indescribable appearance of
lumpiness (I believe, too, they've put them on the wrong feet). But I
don't say this. It is not criticism, but flattery that she wants; and I
gush over them with what I feel to myself to be degrading effusiveness.
Nothing else would satisfy this self-opinionated cherub. I tried the
conscientious-friend dodge with her on one occasion, but it was not
a success. She had requested my judgment upon her general conduct and
behavior, the exact case submitted being, "Wot oo tink of me? Oo peased
wi' me?" and I had thought it a good opportunity to make a few salutary
remarks upon her late moral career, and said: "No, I am not pleased with
you." I recalled to her mind the events of that very morning, and I put
it to her how she, as a Christian child, could expect a wise and good
uncle to be satisfied with the carryings on of an infant who that very
day had roused the whole house at five AM.; had upset a water-jug and
tumbled downstairs after it at seven; had endeavored to put the cat in
the bath at eight; and sat on her own father's hat at nine thirty-five.

What did she do? Was she grateful to me for my plain speaking? Did she
ponder upon my words and determine to profit by them and to lead from
that hour a better and nobler life?

No! she howled.

That done, she became abusive. She said:

"Oo naughty--oo naughty, bad unkie--oo bad man--me tell MAR."

And she did, too.

Since then, when my views have been called for I have kept my real
sentiments more to myself like, preferring to express unbounded
admiration of this young person's actions, irrespective of their actual
merits. And she nods her head approvingly and trots off to advertise my
opinion to the rest of the household. She appears to employ it as a sort
of testimonial for mercenary purposes, for I subsequently hear
distant sounds of "Unkie says me dood dirl--me dot to have two bikkies
[biscuits]."

There she goes, now, gazing rapturously at her own toes and murmuring
"pittie"--two-foot-ten of conceit and vanity, to say nothing of other
wickednesses.

They are all alike. I remember sitting in a garden one sunny afternoon
in the suburbs of London. Suddenly I heard a shrill treble voice calling
from a top-story window to some unseen being, presumably in one of the
other gardens, "Gamma, me dood boy, me wery good boy, gamma; me dot on
Bob's knickiebockies."

Why, even animals are vain. I saw a great Newfoundland dog the other
day sitting in front of a mirror at the entrance to a shop in Regent's
Circus, and examining himself with an amount of smug satisfaction that I
have never seen equaled elsewhere outside a vestry meeting.

I was at a farm-house once when some high holiday was being celebrated.
I don't remember what the occasion was, but it was something festive,
a May Day or Quarter Day, or something of that sort, and they put a
garland of flowers round the head of one of the cows. Well, that absurd
quadruped went about all day as perky as a schoolgirl in a new frock;
and when they took the wreath off she became quite sulky, and they had
to put it on again before she would stand still to be milked. This is
not a Percy anecdote. It is plain, sober truth.

As for cats, they nearly equal human beings for vanity. I have known
a cat get up and walk out of the room on a remark derogatory to her
species being made by a visitor, while a neatly turned compliment will
set them purring for an hour.

I do like cats. They are so unconsciously amusing. There is such a comic
dignity about them, such a "How dare you!" "Go away, don't touch me"
sort of air. Now, there is nothing haughty about a dog. They are "Hail,
fellow, well met" with every Tom, Dick, or Harry that they come
across. When I meet a dog of my acquaintance I slap his head, call him
opprobrious epithets, and roll him over on his back; and there he lies,
gaping at me, and doesn't mind it a bit.

Fancy carrying on like that with a cat! Why, she would never speak to
you again as long as you lived. No, when you want to win the approbation
of a cat you must mind what you are about and work your way carefully.
If you don't know the cat, you had best begin by saying, "Poor pussy."
After which add "did 'ums" in a tone of soothing sympathy. You don't
know what you mean any more than the cat does, but the sentiment
seems to imply a proper spirit on your part, and generally touches her
feelings to such an extent that if you are of good manners and passable
appearance she will stick her back up and rub her nose against you.
Matters having reached this stage, you may venture to chuck her under
the chin and tickle the side of her head, and the intelligent creature
will then stick her claws into your legs; and all is friendship and
affection, as so sweetly expressed in the beautiful lines--

     "I love little pussy, her coat is so warm,
     And if I don't tease her she'll do me no harm;
     So I'll stroke her, and pat her, and feed her with food,
     And pussy will love me because I am good."

The last two lines of the stanza give us a pretty true insight into
pussy's notions of human goodness. It is evident that in her opinion
goodness consists of stroking her, and patting her, and feeding her with
food. I fear this narrow-minded view of virtue, though, is not confined
to pussies. We are all inclined to adopt a similar standard of merit in
our estimate of other people. A good man is a man who is good to us, and
a bad man is a man who doesn't do what we want him to. The truth is,
we each of us have an inborn conviction that the whole world, with
everybody and everything in it, was created as a sort of necessary
appendage to ourselves. Our fellow men and women were made to admire us
and to minister to our various requirements. You and I, dear reader, are
each the center of the universe in our respective opinions. You, as I
understand it, were brought into being by a considerate Providence in
order that you might read and pay me for what I write; while I, in your
opinion, am an article sent into the world to write something for you
to read. The stars--as we term the myriad other worlds that are rushing
down beside us through the eternal silence--were put into the heavens
to make the sky look interesting for us at night; and the moon with its
dark mysteries and ever-hidden face is an arrangement for us to flirt
under.

I fear we are most of us like Mrs. Poyser's bantam cock, who fancied the
sun got up every morning to hear him crow. "'Tis vanity that makes the
world go round." I don't believe any man ever existed without vanity,
and if he did he would be an extremely uncomfortable person to have
anything to do with. He would, of course, be a very good man, and we
should respect him very much. He would be a very admirable man--a man
to be put under a glass case and shown round as a specimen--a man to be
stuck upon a pedestal and copied, like a school exercise--a man to be
reverenced, but not a man to be loved, not a human brother whose hand we
should care to grip. Angels may be very excellent sort of folk in their
way, but we, poor mortals, in our present state, would probably find
them precious slow company. Even mere good people are rather depressing.
It is in our faults and failings, not in our virtues, that we touch
one another and find sympathy. We differ widely enough in our nobler
qualities. It is in our follies that we are at one. Some of us are
pious, some of us are generous. Some few of us are honest, comparatively
speaking; and some, fewer still, may possibly be truthful. But in vanity
and kindred weaknesses we can all join hands. Vanity is one of those
touches of nature that make the whole world kin. From the Indian hunter,
proud of his belt of scalps, to the European general, swelling beneath
his row of stars and medals; from the Chinese, gleeful at the length of
his pigtail, to the "professional beauty," suffering tortures in order
that her waist may resemble a peg-top; from draggle-tailed little Polly
Stiggins, strutting through Seven Dials with a tattered parasol over her
head, to the princess sweeping through a drawing-room with a train of
four yards long; from 'Arry, winning by vulgar chaff the loud laughter
of his pals, to the statesman whose ears are tickled by the cheers
that greet his high-sounding periods; from the dark-skinned African,
bartering his rare oils and ivory for a few glass beads to hang about
his neck, to the Christian maiden selling her white body for a score of
tiny stones and an empty title to tack before her name--all march, and
fight, and bleed, and die beneath its tawdry flag.

Ay, ay, vanity is truly the motive-power that moves humanity, and it
is flattery that greases the wheels. If you want to win affection and
respect in this world, you must flatter people. Flatter high and low,
and rich and poor, and silly and wise. You will get on famously. Praise
this man's virtues and that man's vices. Compliment everybody upon
everything, and especially upon what they haven't got. Admire guys for
their beauty, fools for their wit, and boors for their breeding. Your
discernment and intelligence will be extolled to the skies.

Every one can be got over by flattery. The belted earl--"belted earl" is
the correct phrase, I believe. I don't know what it means, unless it be
an earl that wears a belt instead of braces. Some men do. I don't like
it myself. You have to keep the thing so tight for it to be of any use,
and that is uncomfortable. Anyhow, whatever particular kind of an earl
a belted earl may be, he is, I assert, get-overable by flattery; just as
every other human being is, from a duchess to a cat's-meat man, from a
plow boy to a poet--and the poet far easier than the plowboy, for butter
sinks better into wheaten bread than into oaten cakes.

As for love, flattery is its very life-blood. Fill a person with love
for themselves, and what runs over will be your share, says a certain
witty and truthful Frenchman whose name I can't for the life of me
remember. (Confound it! I never can remember names when I want to.) Tell
a girl she is an angel, only more angelic than an angel; that she is
a goddess, only more graceful, queenly, and heavenly than the average
goddess; that she is more fairy-like than Titania, more beautiful than
Venus, more enchanting than Parthenope; more adorable, lovely, and
radiant, in short, than any other woman that ever did live, does live,
or could live, and you will make a very favorable impression upon her
trusting little heart. Sweet innocent! she will believe every word you
say. It is so easy to deceive a woman--in this way.

Dear little souls, they hate flattery, so they tell you; and when you
say, "Ah, darling, it isn't flattery in your case, it's plain, sober
truth; you really are, without exaggeration, the most beautiful, the
most good, the most charming, the most divine, the most perfect human
creature that ever trod this earth," they will smile a quiet, approving
smile, and, leaning against your manly shoulder, murmur that you are a
dear good fellow after all.

By Jove! fancy a man trying to make love on strictly truthful
principles, determining never to utter a word of mere compliment or
hyperbole, but to scrupulously confine himself to exact fact! Fancy his
gazing rapturously into his mistress' eyes and whispering softly to her
that she wasn't, on the whole, bad-looking, as girls went! Fancy his
holding up her little hand and assuring her that it was of a light drab
color shot with red; and telling her as he pressed her to his heart that
her nose, for a turned-up one, seemed rather pretty; and that her eyes
appeared to him, as far as he could judge, to be quite up to the average
standard of such things!

A nice chance he would stand against the man who would tell her that her
face was like a fresh blush rose, that her hair was a wandering sunbeam
imprisoned by her smiles, and her eyes like two evening stars.

There are various ways of flattering, and, of course, you must adapt
your style to your subject. Some people like it laid on with a trowel,
and this requires very little art. With sensible persons, however, it
needs to be done very delicately, and more by suggestion than actual
words. A good many like it wrapped up in the form of an insult, as--"Oh,
you are a perfect fool, you are. You would give your last sixpence to
the first hungry-looking beggar you met;" while others will swallow it
only when administered through the medium of a third person, so that if
C wishes to get at an A of this sort, he must confide to A's particular
friend B that he thinks A a splendid fellow, and beg him, B, not to
mention it, especially to A. Be careful that B is a reliable man,
though, otherwise he won't.

Those fine, sturdy John Bulls who "hate flattery, sir," "Never let
anybody get over me by flattery," etc., etc., are very simply managed.
Flatter them enough upon their absence of vanity, and you can do what
you like with them.

After all, vanity is as much a virtue as a vice. It is easy to recite
copy-book maxims against its sinfulness, but it is a passion that can
move us to good as well as to evil. Ambition is only vanity ennobled. We
want to win praise and admiration--or fame as we prefer to name it--and
so we write great books, and paint grand pictures, and sing sweet songs;
and toil with willing hands in study, loom, and laboratory.

We wish to become rich men, not in order to enjoy ease and comfort--all
that any one man can taste of those may be purchased anywhere for 200
pounds per annum--but that our houses may be bigger and more gaudily
furnished than our neighbors'; that our horses and servants may be
more numerous; that we may dress our wives and daughters in absurd
but expensive clothes; and that we may give costly dinners of which we
ourselves individually do not eat a shilling's worth. And to do this we
aid the world's work with clear and busy brain, spreading commerce among
its peoples, carrying civilization to its remotest corners.

Do not let us abuse vanity, therefore. Rather let us use it. Honor
itself is but the highest form of vanity. The instinct is not confined
solely to Beau Brummels and Dolly Vardens. There is the vanity of the
peacock and the vanity of the eagle. Snobs are vain. But so, too, are
heroes. Come, oh! my young brother bucks, let us be vain together. Let
us join hands and help each other to increase our vanity. Let us be
vain, not of our trousers and hair, but of brave hearts and working
hands, of truth, of purity, of nobility. Let us be too vain to stoop
to aught that is mean or base, too vain for petty selfishness and
little-minded envy, too vain to say an unkind word or do an unkind act.
Let us be vain of being single-hearted, upright gentlemen in the
midst of a world of knaves. Let us pride ourselves upon thinking high
thoughts, achieving great deeds, living good lives.




ON GETTING ON IN THE WORLD.

Not exactly the sort of thing for an idle fellow to think about, is it?
But outsiders, you know, often see most of the game; and sitting in my
arbor by the wayside, smoking my hookah of contentment and eating
the sweet lotus-leaves of indolence, I can look out musingly upon the
whirling throng that rolls and tumbles past me on the great high-road of
life.

Never-ending is the wild procession. Day and night you can hear the
quick tramp of the myriad feet--some running, some walking, some
halting and lame; but all hastening, all eager in the feverish race, all
straining life and limb and heart and soul to reach the ever-receding
horizon of success.

Mark them as they surge along--men and women, old and young, gentle
and simple, fair and foul, rich and poor, merry and sad--all hurrying,
bustling, scrambling. The strong pushing aside the weak, the cunning
creeping past the foolish; those behind elbowing those before; those
in front kicking, as they run, at those behind. Look close and see the
flitting show. Here is an old man panting for breath, and there a timid
maiden driven by a hard and sharp-faced matron; here is a studious
youth, reading "How to Get On in the World" and letting everybody
pass him as he stumbles along with his eyes on his book; here is a
bored-looking man, with a fashionably dressed woman jogging his elbow;
here a boy gazing wistfully back at the sunny village that he
never again will see; here, with a firm and easy step, strides a
broad-shouldered man; and here, with stealthy tread, a thin-faced,
stooping fellow dodges and shuffles upon his way; here, with gaze fixed
always on the ground, an artful rogue carefully works his way from side
to side of the road and thinks he is going forward; and here a youth
with a noble face stands, hesitating as he looks from the distant goal
to the mud beneath his feet.

And now into sight comes a fair girl, with her dainty face growing more
wrinkled at every step, and now a care-worn man, and now a hopeful lad.

A motley throng--a motley throng! Prince and beggar, sinner and saint,
butcher and baker and candlestick maker, tinkers and tailors, and
plowboys and sailors--all jostling along together. Here the counsel
in his wig and gown, and here the old Jew clothes-man under his dingy
tiara; here the soldier in his scarlet, and here the undertaker's mute
in streaming hat-band and worn cotton gloves; here the musty scholar
fumbling his faded leaves, and here the scented actor dangling his showy
seals. Here the glib politician crying his legislative panaceas, and
here the peripatetic Cheap-Jack holding aloft his quack cures for human
ills. Here the sleek capitalist and there the sinewy laborer; here
the man of science and here the shoe-back; here the poet and here
the water-rate collector; here the cabinet minister and there the
ballet-dancer. Here a red-nosed publican shouting the praises of his
vats and there a temperance lecturer at 50 pounds a night; here a judge
and there a swindler; here a priest and there a gambler. Here a jeweled
duchess, smiling and gracious; here a thin lodging-house keeper,
irritable with cooking; and here a wabbling, strutting thing, tawdry in
paint and finery.

Cheek by cheek they struggle onward. Screaming, cursing, and praying,
laughing, singing, and moaning, they rush past side by side. Their speed
never slackens, the race never ends. There is no wayside rest for them,
no halt by cooling fountains, no pause beneath green shades. On, on,
on--on through the heat and the crowd and the dust--on, or they will
be trampled down and lost--on, with throbbing brain and tottering
limbs--on, till the heart grows sick, and the eyes grow blurred, and a
gurgling groan tells those behind they may close up another space.

And yet, in spite of the killing pace and the stony track, who but
the sluggard or the dolt can hold aloof from the course? Who--like the
belated traveler that stands watching fairy revels till he snatches and
drains the goblin cup and springs into the whirling circle--can view the
mad tumult and not be drawn into its midst? Not I, for one. I confess to
the wayside arbor, the pipe of contentment, and the lotus-leaves
being altogether unsuitable metaphors. They sounded very nice and
philosophical, but I'm afraid I am not the sort of person to sit in
arbors smoking pipes when there is any fun going on outside. I think
I more resemble the Irishman who, seeing a crowd collecting, sent his
little girl out to ask if there was going to be a row--"'Cos, if so,
father would like to be in it."

I love the fierce strife. I like to watch it. I like to hear of people
getting on in it--battling their way bravely and fairly--that is, not
slipping through by luck or trickery. It stirs one's old Saxon fighting
blood like the tales of "knights who fought 'gainst fearful odds" that
thrilled us in our school-boy days.

And fighting the battle of life is fighting against fearful odds, too.
There are giants and dragons in this nineteenth century, and the golden
casket that they guard is not so easy to win as it appears in the
story-books. There, Algernon takes one long, last look at the ancestral
hall, dashes the tear-drop from his eye, and goes off--to return in
three years' time, rolling in riches. The authors do not tell us "how
it's done," which is a pity, for it would surely prove exciting.

But then not one novelist in a thousand ever does tell us the real story
of their hero. They linger for a dozen pages over a tea-party, but sum
up a life's history with "he had become one of our merchant princes," or
"he was now a great artist, with the world at his feet." Why, there
is more real life in one of Gilbert's patter-songs than in half the
biographical novels ever written. He relates to us all the various steps
by which his office-boy rose to be the "ruler of the queen's navee," and
explains to us how the briefless barrister managed to become a great and
good judge, "ready to try this breach of promise of marriage." It is
in the petty details, not in the great results, that the interest of
existence lies.

What we really want is a novel showing us all the hidden under-current
of an ambitious man's career--his struggles, and failures, and hopes,
his disappointments and victories. It would be an immense success. I am
sure the wooing of Fortune would prove quite as interesting a tale as
the wooing of any flesh-and-blood maiden, though, by the way, it would
read extremely similar; for Fortune is, indeed, as the ancients painted
her, very like a woman--not quite so unreasonable and inconsistent, but
nearly so--and the pursuit is much the same in one case as in the other.
Ben Jonson's couplet--

     "Court a mistress, she denies you;
     Let her alone, she will court you"--

puts them both in a nutshell. A woman never thoroughly cares for her
lover until he has ceased to care for her; and it is not until you have
snapped your fingers in Fortune's face and turned on your heel that she
begins to smile upon you.

But by that time you do not much care whether she smiles or frowns. Why
could she not have smiled when her smiles would have filled you with
ecstasy? Everything comes too late in this world.

Good people say that it is quite right and proper that it should be so,
and that it proves ambition is wicked.

Bosh! Good people are altogether wrong. (They always are, in my opinion.
We never agree on any single point.) What would the world do without
ambitious people, I should like to know? Why, it would be as flabby as
a Norfolk dumpling. Ambitious people are the leaven which raises it into
wholesome bread. Without ambitious people the world would never get
up. They are busybodies who are about early in the morning, hammering,
shouting, and rattling the fire-irons, and rendering it generally
impossible for the rest of the house to remain in bed.

Wrong to be ambitious, forsooth! The men wrong who, with bent back and
sweating brow, cut the smooth road over which humanity marches forward
from generation to generation! Men wrong for using the talents that
their Master has intrusted to them--for toiling while others play!

Of course they are seeking their reward. Man is not given that godlike
unselfishness that thinks only of others' good. But in working for
themselves they are working for us all. We are so bound together that no
man can labor for himself alone. Each blow he strikes in his own behalf
helps to mold the universe. The stream in struggling onward turns the
mill-wheel; the coral insect, fashioning its tiny cell, joins continents
to one another; and the ambitious man, building a pedestal for himself,
leaves a monument to posterity. Alexander and Caesar fought for their
own ends, but in doing so they put a belt of civilization half round
the earth. Stephenson, to win a fortune, invented the steam-engine; and
Shakespeare wrote his plays in order to keep a comfortable home for Mrs.
Shakespeare and the little Shakespeares.

Contented, unambitious people are all very well in their way. They form
a neat, useful background for great portraits to be painted against, and
they make a respectable, if not particularly intelligent, audience for
the active spirits of the age to play before. I have not a word to say
against contented people so long as they keep quiet. But do not, for
goodness' sake, let them go strutting about, as they are so fond of
doing, crying out that they are the true models for the whole species.
Why, they are the deadheads, the drones in the great hive, the street
crowds that lounge about, gaping at those who are working.

And let them not imagine, either--as they are also fond of doing--that
they are very wise and philosophical and that it is a very artful
thing to be contented. It may be true that "a contented mind is happy
anywhere," but so is a Jerusalem pony, and the consequence is that both
are put anywhere and are treated anyhow. "Oh, you need not bother about
him," is what is said; "he is very contented as he is, and it would be a
pity to disturb him." And so your contented party is passed over and the
discontented man gets his place.

If you are foolish enough to be contented, don't show it, but grumble
with the rest; and if you can do with a little, ask for a great deal.
Because if you don't you won't get any. In this world it is necessary to
adopt the principle pursued by the plaintiff in an action for damages,
and to demand ten times more than you are ready to accept. If you can
feel satisfied with a hundred, begin by insisting on a thousand; if you
start by suggesting a hundred you will only get ten.

It was by not following this simple plan that poor Jean Jacques Rousseau
came to such grief. He fixed the summit of his earthly bliss at living
in an orchard with an amiable woman and a cow, and he never attained
even that. He did get as far as the orchard, but the woman was not
amiable, and she brought her mother with her, and there was no cow. Now,
if he had made up his mind for a large country estate, a houseful of
angels, and a cattle-show, he might have lived to possess his kitchen
garden and one head of live-stock, and even possibly have come across
that _rara-avis_--a really amiable woman.

What a terribly dull affair, too, life must be for contented people!
How heavy the time must hang upon their hands, and what on earth do they
occupy their thoughts with, supposing that they have any? Reading the
paper and smoking seems to be the intellectual food of the majority
of them, to which the more energetic add playing the flute and talking
about the affairs of the next-door neighbor.

They never knew the excitement of expectation nor the stern delight of
accomplished effort, such as stir the pulse of the man who has objects,
and hopes, and plans. To the ambitious man life is a brilliant game--a
game that calls forth all his tact and energy and nerve--a game to be
won, in the long run, by the quick eye and the steady hand, and yet
having sufficient chance about its working out to give it all the
glorious zest of uncertainty. He exults in it as the strong swimmer in
the heaving billows, as the athlete in the wrestle, the soldier in the
battle.

And if he be defeated he wins the grim joy of fighting; if he lose the
race, he, at least, has had a run. Better to work and fail than to sleep
one's life away.

So, walk up, walk up, walk up. Walk up, ladies and gentlemen! walk up,
boys and girls! Show your skill and try your strength; brave your luck
and prove your pluck. Walk up! The show is never closed and the game is
always going. The only genuine sport in all the fair, gentlemen--highly
respectable and strictly moral--patronized by the nobility, clergy, and
gentry. Established in the year one, gentlemen, and been flourishing
ever since--walk up! Walk up, ladies and gentlemen, and take a hand.
There are prizes for all and all can play. There is gold for the man and
fame for the boy; rank for the maiden and pleasure for the fool. So walk
up, ladies and gentlemen, walk up!--all prizes and no blanks; for some
few win, and as to the rest, why--

     "The rapture of pursuing
     Is the prize the vanquished gain."




ON THE WEATHER.

Things do go so contrary-like with me. I wanted to hit upon an
especially novel, out-of-the-way subject for one of these articles. "I
will write one paper about something altogether new," I said to myself;
"something that nobody else has ever written or talked about before; and
then I can have it all my own way." And I went about for days, trying to
think of something of this kind; and I couldn't. And Mrs. Cutting, our
charwoman, came yesterday--I don't mind mentioning her name, because I
know she will not see this book. She would not look at such a frivolous
publication. She never reads anything but the Bible and _Lloyd's Weekly
News_. All other literature she considers unnecessary and sinful.

She said: "Lor', sir, you do look worried."

I said: "Mrs. Cutting, I am trying to think of a subject the discussion
of which will come upon the world in the nature of a startler--some
subject upon which no previous human being has ever said a word--some
subject that will attract by its novelty, invigorate by its surprising
freshness."

She laughed and said I was a funny gentleman.

That's my luck again. When I make serious observations people chuckle;
when I attempt a joke nobody sees it. I had a beautiful one last week.
I thought it so good, and I worked it up and brought it in artfully at
a dinner-party. I forget how exactly, but we had been talking about the
attitude of Shakespeare toward the Reformation, and I said something and
immediately added, "Ah, that reminds me; such a funny thing happened the
other day in Whitechapel." "Oh," said they, "what was that?" "Oh, 'twas
awfully funny," I replied, beginning to giggle myself; "it will make you
roar;" and I told it them.

There was dead silence when I finished--it was one of those long jokes,
too--and then, at last, somebody said: "And that was the joke?"

I assured them that it was, and they were very polite and took my word
for it. All but one old gentleman at the other end of the table, who
wanted to know which was the joke--what he said to her or what she said
to him; and we argued it out.

Some people are too much the other way. I knew a fellow once whose
natural tendency to laugh at everything was so strong that if you wanted
to talk seriously to him, you had to explain beforehand that what you
were going to say would not be amusing. Unless you got him to clearly
understand this, he would go off into fits of merriment over every word
you uttered. I have known him on being asked the time stop short in the
middle of the road, slap his leg, and burst into a roar of laughter.
One never dared say anything really funny to that man. A good joke would
have killed him on the spot.

In the present instance I vehemently repudiated the accusation of
frivolity, and pressed Mrs. Cutting for practical ideas. She then became
thoughtful and hazarded "samplers;" saying that she never heard them
spoken much of now, but that they used to be all the rage when she was a
girl.

I declined samplers and begged her to think again. She pondered a long
while, with a tea-tray in her hands, and at last suggested the weather,
which she was sure had been most trying of late.

And ever since that idiotic suggestion I have been unable to get the
weather out of my thoughts or anything else in.

It certainly is most wretched weather. At all events it is so now at the
time I am writing, and if it isn't particularly unpleasant when I come
to be read it soon will be.

It always is wretched weather according to us. The weather is like the
government--always in the wrong. In summer-time we say it is stifling;
in winter that it is killing; in spring and autumn we find fault with it
for being neither one thing nor the other and wish it would make up its
mind. If it is fine we say the country is being ruined for want of rain;
if it does rain we pray for fine weather. If December passes without
snow, we indignantly demand to know what has become of our good
old-fashioned winters, and talk as if we had been cheated out of
something we had bought and paid for; and when it does snow, our
language is a disgrace to a Christian nation. We shall never be content
until each man makes his own weather and keeps it to himself.

If that cannot be arranged, we would rather do without it altogether.

Yet I think it is only to us in cities that all weather is so unwelcome.
In her own home, the country, Nature is sweet in all her moods. What
can be more beautiful than the snow, falling big with mystery in silent
softness, decking the fields and trees with white as if for a fairy
wedding! And how delightful is a walk when the frozen ground rings
beneath our swinging tread--when our blood tingles in the rare keen air,
and the sheep-dogs' distant bark and children's laughter peals faintly
clear like Alpine bells across the open hills! And then skating!
scudding with wings of steel across the swaying ice, making whirring
music as we fly. And oh, how dainty is spring--Nature at sweet eighteen!

When the little hopeful leaves peep out so fresh and green, so pure and
bright, like young lives pushing shyly out into the bustling world; when
the fruit-tree blossoms, pink and white, like village maidens in their
Sunday frocks, hide each whitewashed cottage in a cloud of fragile
splendor; and the cuckoo's note upon the breeze is wafted through the
woods! And summer, with its deep dark green and drowsy hum--when the
rain-drops whisper solemn secrets to the listening leaves and the
twilight lingers in the lanes! And autumn! ah, how sadly fair, with its
golden glow and the dying grandeur of its tinted woods--its blood-red
sunsets and its ghostly evening mists, with its busy murmur of reapers,
and its laden orchards, and the calling of the gleaners, and the
festivals of praise!

The very rain, and sleet, and hail seem only Nature's useful servants
when found doing their simple duties in the country; and the East Wind
himself is nothing worse than a boisterous friend when we meet him
between the hedge-rows.

But in the city where the painted stucco blisters under the smoky sun,
and the sooty rain brings slush and mud, and the snow lies piled in
dirty heaps, and the chill blasts whistle down dingy streets and shriek
round flaring gas lit corners, no face of Nature charms us. Weather in
towns is like a skylark in a counting-house--out of place and in the
way. Towns ought to be covered in, warmed by hot-water pipes, and
lighted by electricity. The weather is a country lass and does not
appear to advantage in town. We liked well enough to flirt with her in
the hay-field, but she does not seem so fascinating when we meet her
in Pall Mall. There is too much of her there. The frank, free laugh
and hearty voice that sounded so pleasant in the dairy jars against the
artificiality of town-bred life, and her ways become exceedingly trying.

Just lately she has been favoring us with almost incessant rain for
about three weeks; and I am a demned damp, moist, unpleasant body, as
Mr. Mantalini puts it.

Our next-door neighbor comes out in the back garden every now and then
and says it's doing the country a world of good--not his coming out into
the back garden, but the weather. He doesn't understand anything about
it, but ever since he started a cucumber-frame last summer he has
regarded himself in the light of an agriculturist, and talks in this
absurd way with the idea of impressing the rest of the terrace with the
notion that he is a retired farmer. I can only hope that for this once
he is correct, and that the weather really is doing good to something,
because it is doing me a considerable amount of damage. It is spoiling
both my clothes and my temper. The latter I can afford, as I have a good
supply of it, but it wounds me to the quick to see my dear old hats and
trousers sinking, prematurely worn and aged, beneath the cold world's
blasts and snows.

There is my new spring suit, too. A beautiful suit it was, and now it is
hanging up so bespattered with mud I can't bear to look at it.

That was Jim's fault, that was. I should never have gone out in it that
night if it had not been for him. I was just trying it on when he came
in. He threw up his arms with a wild yell the moment he caught sight of
it, and exclaimed that he had "got 'em again!"

I said: "Does it fit all right behind?"

"Spiffin, old man," he replied. And then he wanted to know if I was
coming out.

I said "no" at first, but he overruled me. He said that a man with a
suit like that had no right to stop indoors. "Every citizen," said he,
"owes a duty to the public. Each one should contribute to the general
happiness as far as lies in his power. Come out and give the girls a
treat."

Jim is slangy. I don't know where he picks it up. It certainly is not
from me.

I said: "Do you think it will really please 'em?" He said it would be
like a day in the country to them.

That decided me. It was a lovely evening and I went.

When I got home I undressed and rubbed myself down with whisky, put
my feet in hot water and a mustard-plaster on my chest, had a basin of
gruel and a glass of hot brandy-and-water, tallowed my nose, and went to
bed.

These prompt and vigorous measures, aided by a naturally strong
constitution, were the means of preserving my life; but as for the suit!
Well, there, it isn't a suit; it's a splash-board.

And I did fancy that suit, too. But that's just the way. I never do get
particularly fond of anything in this world but what something dreadful
happens to it. I had a tame rat when I was a boy, and I loved that
animal as only a boy would love an old water-rat; and one day it fell
into a large dish of gooseberry-fool that was standing to cool in the
kitchen, and nobody knew what had become of the poor creature until the
second helping.

I do hate wet weather in town. At least, it is not so much the wet
as the mud that I object to. Somehow or other I seem to possess an
irresistible alluring power over mud. I have only to show myself in the
street on a muddy day to be half-smothered by it. It all comes of being
so attractive, as the old lady said when she was struck by lightning.
Other people can go out on dirty days and walk about for hours without
getting a speck upon themselves; while if I go across the road I come
back a perfect disgrace to be seen (as in my boyish days my poor dear
mother tried often to tell me). If there were only one dab of mud to be
found in the whole of London, I am convinced I should carry it off from
all competitors.

I wish I could return the affection, but I fear I never shall be able
to. I have a horror of what they call the "London particular." I feel
miserable and muggy all through a dirty day, and it is quite a relief
to pull one's clothes off and get into bed, out of the way of it all.
Everything goes wrong in wet weather. I don't know how it is, but there
always seem to me to be more people, and dogs, and perambulators, and
cabs, and carts about in wet weather than at any other time, and they
all get in your way more, and everybody is so disagreeable--except
myself--and it does make me so wild. And then, too, somehow I always
find myself carrying more things in wet weather than in dry; and when
you have a bag, and three parcels, and a newspaper, and it suddenly
comes on to rain, you can't open your umbrella.

Which reminds me of another phase of the weather that I can't bear, and
that is April weather (so called because it always comes in May).
Poets think it very nice. As it does not know its own mind five minutes
together, they liken it to a woman; and it is supposed to be very
charming on that account. I don't appreciate it, myself. Such
lightning-change business may be all very agreeable in a girl. It is no
doubt highly delightful to have to do with a person who grins one moment
about nothing at all, and snivels the next for precisely the same cause,
and who then giggles, and then sulks, and who is rude, and affectionate,
and bad-tempered, and jolly, and boisterous, and silent, and passionate,
and cold, and stand-offish, and flopping, all in one minute (mind,
I don't say this. It is those poets. And they are supposed to
be connoisseurs of this sort of thing); but in the weather the
disadvantages of the system are more apparent. A woman's tears do not
make one wet, but the rain does; and her coldness does not lay the
foundations of asthma and rheumatism, as the east wind is apt to. I
can prepare for and put up with a regularly bad day, but these
ha'porth-of-all-sorts kind of days do not suit me. It aggravates me to
see a bright blue sky above me when I am walking along wet through,
and there is something so exasperating about the way the sun comes out
smiling after a drenching shower, and seems to say: "Lord love you, you
don't mean to say you're wet? Well, I am surprised. Why, it was only my
fun."

They don't give you time to open or shut your umbrella in an English
April, especially if it is an "automaton" one--the umbrella, I mean, not
the April.

I bought an "automaton" once in April, and I did have a time with it! I
wanted an umbrella, and I went into a shop in the Strand and told them
so, and they said:

"Yes, sir. What sort of an umbrella would you like?"

I said I should like one that would keep the rain off, and that would
not allow itself to be left behind in a railway carriage.

"Try an 'automaton,'" said the shopman.

"What's an 'automaton'?" said I.

"Oh, it's a beautiful arrangement," replied the man, with a touch of
enthusiasm. "It opens and shuts itself."

I bought one and found that he was quite correct. It did open and shut
itself. I had no control over it whatever. When it began to rain, which
it did that season every alternate five minutes, I used to try and get
the machine to open, but it would not budge; and then I used to stand
and struggle with the wretched thing, and shake it, and swear at it,
while the rain poured down in torrents. Then the moment the rain ceased
the absurd thing would go up suddenly with a jerk and would not come
down again; and I had to walk about under a bright blue sky, with an
umbrella over my head, wishing that it would come on to rain again, so
that it might not seem that I was insane.

When it did shut it did so unexpectedly and knocked one's hat off.

I don't know why it should be so, but it is an undeniable fact that
there is nothing makes a man look so supremely ridiculous as losing
his hat. The feeling of helpless misery that shoots down one's back on
suddenly becoming aware that one's head is bare is among the most bitter
ills that flesh is heir to. And then there is the wild chase after it,
accompanied by an excitable small dog, who thinks it is a game, and
in the course of which you are certain to upset three or four innocent
children--to say nothing of their mothers--butt a fat old gentleman on
to the top of a perambulator, and carom off a ladies' seminary into the
arms of a wet sweep.

After this, the idiotic hilarity of the spectators and the disreputable
appearance of the hat when recovered appear but of minor importance.

Altogether, what between March winds, April showers, and the entire
absence of May flowers, spring is not a success in cities. It is all
very well in the country, as I have said, but in towns whose population
is anything over ten thousand it most certainly ought to be abolished.
In the world's grim workshops it is like the children--out of place.
Neither shows to advantage amid the dust and din. It seems so sad to see
the little dirt-grimed brats try to play in the noisy courts and muddy
streets. Poor little uncared-for, unwanted human atoms, they are not
children. Children are bright-eyed, chubby, and shy. These are dingy,
screeching elves, their tiny faces seared and withered, their baby
laughter cracked and hoarse.

The spring of life and the spring of the year were alike meant to be
cradled in the green lap of nature. To us in the town spring brings but
its cold winds and drizzling rains. We must seek it among the leafless
woods and the brambly lanes, on the heathy moors and the great still
hills, if we want to feel its joyous breath and hear its silent voices.
There is a glorious freshness in the spring there. The scurrying clouds,
the open bleakness, the rushing wind, and the clear bright air thrill
one with vague energies and hopes. Life, like the landscape around us,
seems bigger, and wider, and freer--a rainbow road leading to unknown
ends. Through the silvery rents that bar the sky we seem to catch a
glimpse of the great hope and grandeur that lies around this little
throbbing world, and a breath of its scent is wafted us on the wings of
the wild March wind.

Strange thoughts we do not understand are stirring in our hearts. Voices
are calling us to some great effort, to some mighty work. But we do not
comprehend their meaning yet, and the hidden echoes within us that would
reply are struggling, inarticulate and dumb.

We stretch our hands like children to the light, seeking to grasp we
know not what. Our thoughts, like the boys' thoughts in the Danish song,
are very long, long thoughts, and very vague; we cannot see their end.

It must be so. All thoughts that peer outside this narrow world cannot
be else than dim and shapeless. The thoughts that we can clearly grasp
are very little thoughts--that two and two make four-that when we are
hungry it is pleasant to eat--that honesty is the best policy; all
greater thoughts are undefined and vast to our poor childish brains. We
see but dimly through the mists that roll around our time-girt isle of
life, and only hear the distant surging of the great sea beyond.




ON CATS AND DOGS.

What I've suffered from them this morning no tongue can tell. It
began with Gustavus Adolphus. Gustavus Adolphus (they call him "Gusty"
down-stairs for short) is a very good sort of dog when he is in the
middle of a large field or on a fairly extensive common, but I won't
have him indoors. He means well, but this house is not his size. He
stretches himself, and over go two chairs and a what-not. He wags his
tail, and the room looks as if a devastating army had marched through
it. He breathes, and it puts the fire out.

At dinner-time he creeps in under the table, lies there for awhile, and
then gets up suddenly; the first intimation we have of his movements
being given by the table, which appears animated by a desire to turn
somersaults. We all clutch at it frantically and endeavor to maintain
it in a horizontal position; whereupon his struggles, he being under
the impression that some wicked conspiracy is being hatched against him,
become fearful, and the final picture presented is generally that of
an overturned table and a smashed-up dinner sandwiched between two
sprawling layers of infuriated men and women.

He came in this morning in his usual style, which he appears to have
founded on that of an American cyclone, and the first thing he did was
to sweep my coffee-cup off the table with his tail, sending the contents
full into the middle of my waistcoat.

I rose from my chair hurriedly and remarking "----," approached him at a
rapid rate. He preceded me in the direction of the door. At the door he
met Eliza coming in with eggs. Eliza observed "Ugh!" and sat down on the
floor, the eggs took up different positions about the carpet, where they
spread themselves out, and Gustavus Adolphus left the room. I called
after him, strongly advising him to go straight downstairs and not let
me see him again for the next hour or so; and he seeming to agree with
me, dodged the coal-scoop and went, while I returned, dried myself and
finished breakfast. I made sure that he had gone in to the yard, but
when I looked into the passage ten minutes later he was sitting at the
top of the stairs. I ordered him down at once, but he only barked and
jumped about, so I went to see what was the matter.

It was Tittums. She was sitting on the top stair but one and wouldn't
let him pass.

Tittums is our kitten. She is about the size of a penny roll. Her back
was up and she was swearing like a medical student.

She does swear fearfully. I do a little that way myself sometimes, but
I am a mere amateur compared with her. To tell you the truth--mind, this
is strictly between ourselves, please; I shouldn't like your wife
to know I said it--the women folk don't understand these things; but
between you and me, you know, I think it does a man good to swear.
Swearing is the safety-valve through which the bad temper that might
otherwise do serious internal injury to his mental mechanism escapes in
harmless vaporing. When a man has said: "Bless you, my dear, sweet
sir. What the sun, moon, and stars made you so careless (if I may be
permitted the expression) as to allow your light and delicate foot to
descend upon my corn with so much force? Is it that you are physically
incapable of comprehending the direction in which you are proceeding?
you nice, clever young man--you!" or words to that effect, he feels
better. Swearing has the same soothing effect upon our angry passions
that smashing the furniture or slamming the doors is so well known to
exercise; added to which it is much cheaper. Swearing clears a man out
like a pen'orth of gunpowder does the wash-house chimney. An occasional
explosion is good for both. I rather distrust a man who never swears,
or savagely kicks the foot-stool, or pokes the fire with unnecessary
violence. Without some outlet, the anger caused by the ever-occurring
troubles of life is apt to rankle and fester within. The petty
annoyance, instead of being thrown from us, sits down beside us and
becomes a sorrow, and the little offense is brooded over till, in
the hot-bed of rumination, it grows into a great injury, under whose
poisonous shadow springs up hatred and revenge.

Swearing relieves the feelings--that is what swearing does. I explained
this to my aunt on one occasion, but it didn't answer with her. She said
I had no business to have such feelings.

That is what I told Tittums. I told her she ought to be ashamed of
herself, brought up in at Christian family as she was, too. I don't
so much mind hearing an old cat swear, but I can't bear to see a mere
kitten give way to it. It seems sad in one so young.

I put Tittums in my pocket and returned to my desk. I forgot her for the
moment, and when I looked I found that she had squirmed out of my pocket
on to the table and was trying to swallow the pen; then she put her leg
into the ink-pot and upset it; then she licked her leg; then she swore
again--at me this time.

I put her down on the floor, and there Tim began rowing with her. I do
wish Tim would mind his own business. It was no concern of his what
she had been doing. Besides, he is not a saint himself. He is only a
two-year-old fox-terrier, and he interferes with everything and gives
himself the airs of a gray-headed Scotch collie.

Tittums' mother has come in and Tim has got his nose scratched, for
which I am remarkably glad. I have put them all three out in the
passage, where they are fighting at the present moment. I'm in a mess
with the ink and in a thundering bad temper; and if anything more in the
cat or dog line comes fooling about me this morning, it had better bring
its own funeral contractor with it.

Yet, in general, I like cats and dogs very much indeed. What jolly chaps
they are! They are much superior to human beings as companions. They
do not quarrel or argue with you. They never talk about themselves but
listen to you while you talk about yourself, and keep up an appearance
of being interested in the conversation. They never make stupid remarks.
They never observe to Miss Brown across a dinner-table that they always
understood she was very sweet on Mr. Jones (who has just married Miss
Robinson). They never mistake your wife's cousin for her husband and
fancy that you are the father-in-law. And they never ask a young author
with fourteen tragedies, sixteen comedies, seven farces, and a couple of
burlesques in his desk why he doesn't write a play.

They never say unkind things. They never tell us of our faults, "merely
for our own good." They do not at inconvenient moments mildly remind us
of our past follies and mistakes. They do not say, "Oh, yes, a lot of
use you are if you are ever really wanted"--sarcastic like. They never
inform us, like our _inamoratas_ sometimes do, that we are not nearly so
nice as we used to be. We are always the same to them.

They are always glad to see us. They are with us in all our humors. They
are merry when we are glad, sober when we feel solemn, and sad when we
are sorrowful.

"Halloo! happy and want a lark? Right you are; I'm your man. Here I am,
frisking round you, leaping, barking, pirouetting, ready for any amount
of fun and mischief. Look at my eyes if you doubt me. What shall it be?
A romp in the drawing-room and never mind the furniture, or a scamper
in the fresh, cool air, a scud across the fields and down the hill,
and won't we let old Gaffer Goggles' geese know what time o' day it is,
neither! Whoop! come along."

Or you'd like to be quiet and think. Very well. Pussy can sit on the arm
of the chair and purr, and Montmorency will curl himself up on the rug
and blink at the fire, yet keeping one eye on you the while, in case you
are seized with any sudden desire in the direction of rats.

And when we bury our face in our hands and wish we had never been born,
they don't sit up very straight and observe that we have brought it all
upon ourselves. They don't even hope it will be a warning to us. But
they come up softly and shove their heads against us. If it is a cat she
stands on your shoulder, rumples your hair, and says, "Lor,' I am sorry
for you, old man," as plain as words can speak; and if it is a dog he
looks up at you with his big, true eyes and says with them, "Well you've
always got me, you know. We'll go through the world together and always
stand by each other, won't we?"

He is very imprudent, a dog is. He never makes it his business to
inquire whether you are in the right or in the wrong, never bothers
as to whether you are going up or down upon life's ladder, never asks
whether you are rich or poor, silly or wise, sinner or saint. You are
his pal. That is enough for him, and come luck or misfortune, good
repute or bad, honor or shame, he is going to stick to you, to
comfort you, guard you, and give his life for you if need be--foolish,
brainless, soulless dog!

Ah! old stanch friend, with your deep, clear eyes and bright, quick
glances, that take in all one has to say before one has time to speak
it, do you know you are only an animal and have no mind? Do you know
that that dull-eyed, gin-sodden lout leaning against the post out there
is immeasurably your intellectual superior? Do you know that every
little-minded, selfish scoundrel who lives by cheating and tricking,
who never did a gentle deed or said a kind word, who never had a thought
that was not mean and low or a desire that was not base, whose every
action is a fraud, whose every utterance is a lie--do you know that
these crawling skulks (and there are millions of them in the world), do
you know they are all as much superior to you as the sun is superior to
rushlight you honorable, brave-hearted, unselfish brute? They are MEN,
you know, and MEN are the greatest, and noblest, and wisest, and best
beings in the whole vast eternal universe. Any man will tell you that.

Yes, poor doggie, you are very stupid, very stupid indeed, compared with
us clever men, who understand all about politics and philosophy, and who
know everything, in short, except what we are and where we came from and
whither we are going, and what everything outside this tiny world and
most things in it are.

Never mind, though, pussy and doggie, we like you both all the better
for your being stupid. We all like stupid things. Men can't bear clever
women, and a woman's ideal man is some one she can call a "dear old
stupid." It is so pleasant to come across people more stupid than
ourselves. We love them at once for being so. The world must be rather
a rough place for clever people. Ordinary folk dislike them, and as for
themselves, they hate each other most cordially.

But there, the clever people are such a very insignificant minority
that it really doesn't much matter if they are unhappy. So long as the
foolish people can be made comfortable the world, as a whole, will get
on tolerably well.

Cats have the credit of being more worldly wise than dogs--of looking
more after their own interests and being less blindly devoted to those
of their friends. And we men and women are naturally shocked at such
selfishness. Cats certainly do love a family that has a carpet in the
kitchen more than a family that has not; and if there are many children
about, they prefer to spend their leisure time next door. But, taken
altogether, cats are libeled. Make a friend of one, and she will stick
to you through thick and thin. All the cats that I have had have been
most firm comrades. I had a cat once that used to follow me about
everywhere, until it even got quite embarrassing, and I had to beg
her, as a personal favor, not to accompany me any further down the High
Street. She used to sit up for me when I was late home and meet me in
the passage. It made me feel quite like a married man, except that she
never asked where I had been and then didn't believe me when I told her.

Another cat I had used to get drunk regularly every day. She would hang
about for hours outside the cellar door for the purpose of sneaking
in on the first opportunity and lapping up the drippings from the
beer-cask. I do not mention this habit of hers in praise of the
species, but merely to show how almost human some of them are. If the
transmigration of souls is a fact, this animal was certainly qualifying
most rapidly for a Christian, for her vanity was only second to her love
of drink. Whenever she caught a particularly big rat, she would bring it
up into the room where we were all sitting, lay the corpse down in the
midst of us, and wait to be praised. Lord! how the girls used to scream.

Poor rats! They seem only to exist so that cats and dogs may gain credit
for killing them and chemists make a fortune by inventing specialties
in poison for their destruction. And yet there is something fascinating
about them. There is a weirdness and uncanniness attaching to them. They
are so cunning and strong, so terrible in their numbers, so cruel, so
secret. They swarm in deserted houses, where the broken casements hang
rotting to the crumbling walls and the doors swing creaking on their
rusty hinges. They know the sinking ship and leave her, no one knows how
or whither. They whisper to each other in their hiding-places how a
doom will fall upon the hall and the great name die forgotten. They do
fearful deeds in ghastly charnel-houses.

No tale of horror is complete without the rats. In stories of ghosts
and murderers they scamper through the echoing rooms, and the gnawing of
their teeth is heard behind the wainscot, and their gleaming eyes peer
through the holes in the worm-eaten tapestry, and they scream in shrill,
unearthly notes in the dead of night, while the moaning wind sweeps,
sobbing, round the ruined turret towers, and passes wailing like a woman
through the chambers bare and tenantless.

And dying prisoners, in their loathsome dungeons, see through the
horrid gloom their small red eyes, like glittering coals, hear in
the death-like silence the rush of their claw-like feet, and start up
shrieking in the darkness and watch through the awful night.

I love to read tales about rats. They make my flesh creep so. I like
that tale of Bishop Hatto and the rats. The wicked bishop, you know, had
ever so much corn stored in his granaries and would not let the starving
people touch it, but when they prayed to him for food gathered them
together in his barn, and then shutting the doors on them, set fire
to the place and burned them all to death. But next day there came
thousands upon thousands of rats, sent to do judgment on him. Then
Bishop Hatto fled to his strong tower that stood in the middle of the
Rhine, and barred himself in and fancied he was safe. But the rats! they
swam the river, they gnawed their way through the thick stone walls, and
ate him alive where he sat.

     "They have whetted their teeth against the stones,
     And now they pick the bishop's bones;
     They gnawed the flesh from every limb,
     For they were sent to do judgment on him."

Oh, it's a lovely tale.

Then there is the story of the Pied Piper of Hamelin, how first he piped
the rats away, and afterward, when the mayor broke faith with him,
drew all the children along with him and went into the mountain. What
a curious old legend that is! I wonder what it means, or has it any
meaning at all? There seems something strange and deep lying hid beneath
the rippling rhyme. It haunts me, that picture of the quaint, mysterious
old piper piping through Hamelin's narrow streets, and the children
following with dancing feet and thoughtful, eager faces. The old folks
try to stay them, but the children pay no heed. They hear the weird,
witched music and must follow. The games are left unfinished and the
playthings drop from their careless hands. They know not whither they
are hastening. The mystic music calls to them, and they follow, heedless
and unasking where. It stirs and vibrates in their hearts and other
sounds grow faint. So they wander through Pied Piper Street away from
Hamelin town.

I get thinking sometimes if the Pied Piper is really dead, or if he may
not still be roaming up and down our streets and lanes, but playing now
so softly that only the children hear him. Why do the little faces look
so grave and solemn when they pause awhile from romping, and stand, deep
wrapt, with straining eyes? They only shake their curly heads and dart
back laughing to their playmates when we question them. But I fancy
myself they have been listening to the magic music of the old Pied
Piper, and perhaps with those bright eyes of theirs have even seen his
odd, fantastic figure gliding unnoticed through the whirl and throng.

Even we grown-up children hear his piping now and then. But the yearning
notes are very far away, and the noisy, blustering world is always
bellowing so loud it drowns the dreamlike melody. One day the sweet, sad
strains will sound out full and clear, and then we too shall, like the
little children, throw our playthings all aside and follow. The loving
hands will be stretched out to stay us, and the voices we have learned
to listen for will cry to us to stop. But we shall push the fond arms
gently back and pass out through the sorrowing house and through the
open door. For the wild, strange music will be ringing in our hearts,
and we shall know the meaning of its song by then.

I wish people could love animals without getting maudlin over them, as
so many do. Women are the most hardened offenders in such respects, but
even our intellectual sex often degrade pets into nuisances by absurd
idolatry. There are the gushing young ladies who, having read "David
Copperfield," have thereupon sought out a small, longhaired dog of
nondescript breed, possessed of an irritating habit of criticising
a man's trousers, and of finally commenting upon the same by a sniff
indicative of contempt and disgust. They talk sweet girlish prattle to
this animal (when there is any one near enough to overhear them), and
they kiss its nose, and put its unwashed head up against their cheek in
a most touching manner; though I have noticed that these caresses are
principally performed when there are young men hanging about.

Then there are the old ladies who worship a fat poodle, scant of breath
and full of fleas. I knew a couple of elderly spinsters once who had
a sort of German sausage on legs which they called a dog between them.
They used to wash its face with warm water every morning. It had a
mutton cutlet regularly for breakfast; and on Sundays, when one of the
ladies went to church, the other always stopped at home to keep the dog
company.

There are many families where the whole interest of life is centered
upon the dog. Cats, by the way, rarely suffer from excess of adulation.
A cat possesses a very fair sense of the ridiculous, and will put
her paw down kindly but firmly upon any nonsense of this kind. Dogs,
however, seem to like it. They encourage their owners in the tomfoolery,
and the consequence is that in the circles I am speaking of what "dear
Fido" has done, does do, will do, won't do, can do, can't do, was doing,
is doing, is going to do, shall do, shan't do, and is about to be going
to have done is the continual theme of discussion from morning till
night.

All the conversation, consisting, as it does, of the very dregs of
imbecility, is addressed to this confounded animal. The family sit in
a row all day long, watching him, commenting upon his actions, telling
each other anecdotes about him, recalling his virtues, and remembering
with tears how one day they lost him for two whole hours, on which
occasion he was brought home in a most brutal manner by the butcher-boy,
who had been met carrying him by the scruff of his neck with one hand,
while soundly cuffing his head with the other.

After recovering from these bitter recollections, they vie with each
other in bursts of admiration for the brute, until some more than
usually enthusiastic member, unable any longer to control his feelings,
swoops down upon the unhappy quadruped in a frenzy of affection,
clutches it to his heart, and slobbers over it. Whereupon the others,
mad with envy, rise up, and seizing as much of the dog as the greed of
the first one has left to them, murmur praise and devotion.

Among these people everything is done through the dog. If you want to
make love to the eldest daughter, or get the old man to lend you
the garden roller, or the mother to subscribe to the Society for the
Suppression of Solo-Cornet Players in Theatrical Orchestras (it's a pity
there isn't one, anyhow), you have to begin with the dog. You must
gain its approbation before they will even listen to you, and if, as is
highly probable, the animal, whose frank, doggy nature has been warped
by the unnatural treatment he has received, responds to your overtures
of friendship by viciously snapping at you, your cause is lost forever.

"If Fido won't take to any one," the father has thoughtfully remarked
beforehand, "I say that man is not to be trusted. You know, Maria, how
often I have said that. Ah! he knows, bless him."

Drat him!

And to think that the surly brute was once an innocent puppy, all legs
and head, full of fun and play, and burning with ambition to become a
big, good dog and bark like mother.

Ah me! life sadly changes us all. The world seems a vast horrible
grinding machine, into which what is fresh and bright and pure is pushed
at one end, to come out old and crabbed and wrinkled at the other.

Look even at Pussy Sobersides, with her dull, sleepy glance, her grave,
slow walk, and dignified, prudish airs; who could ever think that once
she was the blue-eyed, whirling, scampering, head-over-heels, mad little
firework that we call a kitten?

What marvelous vitality a kitten has. It is really something very
beautiful the way life bubbles over in the little creatures. They rush
about, and mew, and spring; dance on their hind legs, embrace everything
with their front ones, roll over and over, lie on their backs and kick.
They don't know what to do with themselves, they are so full of life.

Can you remember, reader, when you and I felt something of the same
sort of thing? Can you remember those glorious days of fresh young
manhood--how, when coming home along the moonlit road, we felt too full
of life for sober walking, and had to spring and skip, and wave our
arms, and shout till belated farmers' wives thought--and with good
reason, too--that we were mad, and kept close to the hedge, while we
stood and laughed aloud to see them scuttle off so fast and made their
blood run cold with a wild parting whoop, and the tears came, we knew
not why? Oh, that magnificent young LIFE! that crowned us kings of the
earth; that rushed through every tingling vein till we seemed to walk on
air; that thrilled through our throbbing brains and told us to go forth
and conquer the whole world; that welled up in our young hearts till we
longed to stretch out our arms and gather all the toiling men and women
and the little children to our breast and love them all--all. Ah! they
were grand days, those deep, full days, when our coming life, like an
unseen organ, pealed strange, yearnful music in our ears, and our young
blood cried out like a war-horse for the battle. Ah, our pulse beats
slow and steady now, and our old joints are rheumatic, and we love our
easy-chair and pipe and sneer at boys' enthusiasm. But oh for one brief
moment of that god-like life again!




ON BEING SHY.

All great literary men are shy. I am myself, though I am told it is
hardly noticeable.

I am glad it is not. It used to be extremely prominent at one time, and
was the cause of much misery to myself and discomfort to every one about
me--my lady friends especially complained most bitterly about it.

A shy man's lot is not a happy one. The men dislike him, the women
despise him, and he dislikes and despises himself. Use brings him no
relief, and there is no cure for him except time; though I once came
across a delicious recipe for overcoming the misfortune. It appeared
among the "answers to correspondents" in a small weekly journal and
ran as follows--I have never forgotten it: "Adopt an easy and pleasing
manner, especially toward ladies."

Poor wretch! I can imagine the grin with which he must have read that
advice. "Adopt an easy and pleasing manner, especially toward ladies,"
forsooth! Don't you adopt anything of the kind, my dear young shy
friend. Your attempt to put on any other disposition than your own will
infallibly result in your becoming ridiculously gushing and offensively
familiar. Be your own natural self, and then you will only be thought to
be surly and stupid.

The shy man does have some slight revenge upon society for the torture
it inflicts upon him. He is able, to a certain extent, to communicate
his misery. He frightens other people as much as they frighten him.
He acts like a damper upon the whole room, and the most jovial spirits
become in his presence depressed and nervous.

This is a good deal brought about by misunderstanding. Many people
mistake the shy man's timidity for overbearing arrogance and are
awed and insulted by it. His awkwardness is resented as insolent
carelessness, and when, terror-stricken at the first word addressed to
him, the blood rushes to his head and the power of speech completely
fails him, he is regarded as an awful example of the evil effects of
giving way to passion.

But, indeed, to be misunderstood is the shy man's fate on every
occasion; and whatever impression he endeavors to create, he is sure
to convey its opposite. When he makes a joke, it is looked upon as a
pretended relation of fact and his want of veracity much condemned.
His sarcasm is accepted as his literal opinion and gains for him the
reputation of being an ass, while if, on the other hand, wishing to
ingratiate himself, he ventures upon a little bit of flattery, it is
taken for satire and he is hated ever afterward.

These and the rest of a shy man's troubles are always very amusing to
other people, and have afforded material for comic writing from time
immemorial. But if we look a little deeper we shall find there is a
pathetic, one might almost say a tragic, side to the picture. A shy
man means a lonely man--a man cut off from all companionship, all
sociability. He moves about the world, but does not mix with it. Between
him and his fellow-men there runs ever an impassable barrier--a strong,
invisible wall that, trying in vain to scale, he but bruises himself
against. He sees the pleasant faces and hears the pleasant voices on the
other side, but he cannot stretch his hand across to grasp another hand.
He stands watching the merry groups, and he longs to speak and to claim
kindred with them. But they pass him by, chatting gayly to one another,
and he cannot stay them. He tries to reach them, but his prison walls
move with him and hem him in on every side. In the busy street, in the
crowded room, in the grind of work, in the whirl of pleasure, amid the
many or amid the few--wherever men congregate together, wherever the
music of human speech is heard and human thought is flashed from human
eyes, there, shunned and solitary, the shy man, like a leper, stands
apart. His soul is full of love and longing, but the world knows it not.
The iron mask of shyness is riveted before his face, and the man beneath
is never seen. Genial words and hearty greetings are ever rising to his
lips, but they die away in unheard whispers behind the steel clamps. His
heart aches for the weary brother, but his sympathy is dumb. Contempt
and indignation against wrong choke up his throat, and finding no
safety-valve whence in passionate utterance they may burst forth, they
only turn in again and harm him. All the hate and scorn and love of a
deep nature such as the shy man is ever cursed by fester and corrupt
within, instead of spending themselves abroad, and sour him into a
misanthrope and cynic.

Yes, shy men, like ugly women, have a bad time of it in this world, to
go through which with any comfort needs the hide of a rhinoceros. Thick
skin is, indeed, our moral clothes, and without it we are not fit to be
seen about in civilized society. A poor gasping, blushing creature, with
trembling knees and twitching hands, is a painful sight to every one,
and if it cannot cure itself, the sooner it goes and hangs itself the
better.

The disease can be cured. For the comfort of the shy, I can assure them
of that from personal experience. I do not like speaking about myself,
as may have been noticed, but in the cause of humanity I on this
occasion will do so, and will confess that at one time I was, as the
young man in the Bab Ballad says, "the shyest of the shy," and "whenever
I was introduced to any pretty maid, my knees they knocked together just
as if I was afraid." Now, I would--nay, have--on this very day
before yesterday I did the deed. Alone and entirely by myself (as the
school-boy said in translating the "Bellum Gallicum") did I beard a
railway refreshment-room young lady in her own lair. I rebuked her in
terms of mingled bitterness and sorrow for her callousness and want of
condescension. I insisted, courteously but firmly, on being accorded
that deference and attention that was the right of the traveling Briton,
and at the end I looked her full in the face. Need I say more?

True, immediately after doing so I left the room with what may
possibly have appeared to be precipitation and without waiting for any
refreshment. But that was because I had changed my mind, not because I
was frightened, you understand.

One consolation that shy folk can take unto themselves is that shyness
is certainly no sign of stupidity. It is easy enough for bull-headed
clowns to sneer at nerves, but the highest natures are not necessarily
those containing the greatest amount of moral brass. The horse is not an
inferior animal to the cock-sparrow, nor the deer of the forest to the
pig. Shyness simply means extreme sensibility, and has nothing whatever
to do with self-consciousness or with conceit, though its relationship
to both is continually insisted upon by the poll-parrot school of
philosophy.

Conceit, indeed, is the quickest cure for it. When it once begins to
dawn upon you that you are a good deal cleverer than any one else in
this world, bashfulness becomes shocked and leaves you. When you can
look round a roomful of people and think that each one is a mere child
in intellect compared with yourself you feel no more shy of them than
you would of a select company of magpies or orang-outangs.

Conceit is the finest armor that a man can wear. Upon its smooth,
impenetrable surface the puny dagger-thrusts of spite and envy glance
harmlessly aside. Without that breast-plate the sword of talent cannot
force its way through the battle of life, for blows have to be borne as
well as dealt. I do not, of course, speak of the conceit that displays
itself in an elevated nose and a falsetto voice. That is not real
conceit--that is only playing at being conceited; like children play
at being kings and queens and go strutting about with feathers and
long trains. Genuine conceit does not make a man objectionable. On the
contrary, it tends to make him genial, kind-hearted, and simple. He
has no need of affectation--he is far too well satisfied with his own
character; and his pride is too deep-seated to appear at all on
the outside. Careless alike of praise or blame, he can afford to be
truthful. Too far, in fancy, above the rest of mankind to trouble
about their petty distinctions, he is equally at home with duke or
costermonger. And valuing no one's standard but his own, he is never
tempted to practice that miserable pretense that less self-reliant
people offer up as an hourly sacrifice to the god of their neighbor's
opinion.

The shy man, on the other hand, is humble--modest of his own judgment
and over-anxious concerning that of others. But this in the case of
a young man is surely right enough. His character is unformed. It is
slowly evolving itself out of a chaos of doubt and disbelief. Before
the growing insight and experience the diffidence recedes. A man rarely
carries his shyness past the hobbledehoy period. Even if his own inward
strength does not throw it off, the rubbings of the world generally
smooth it down. You scarcely ever meet a really shy man--except
in novels or on the stage, where, by the bye, he is much admired,
especially by the women.

There, in that supernatural land, he appears as a fair-haired and
saintlike young man--fair hair and goodness always go together on the
stage. No respectable audience would believe in one without the other.
I knew an actor who mislaid his wig once and had to rush on to play the
hero in his own hair, which was jet-black, and the gallery howled at
all his noble sentiments under the impression that he was the villain.
He--the shy young man--loves the heroine, oh so devotedly (but only
in asides, for he dare not tell her of it), and he is so noble and
unselfish, and speaks in such a low voice, and is so good to his mother;
and the bad people in the play, they laugh at him and jeer at him, but
he takes it all so gently, and in the end it transpires that he is such
a clever man, though nobody knew it, and then the heroine tells him she
loves him, and he is so surprised, and oh, so happy! and everybody loves
him and asks him to forgive them, which he does in a few well-chosen and
sarcastic words, and blesses them; and he seems to have generally such
a good time of it that all the young fellows who are not shy long to be
shy. But the really shy man knows better. He knows that it is not quite
so pleasant in reality. He is not quite so interesting there as in the
fiction. He is a little more clumsy and stupid and a little less devoted
and gentle, and his hair is much darker, which, taken altogether,
considerably alters the aspect of the case.

The point where he does resemble his ideal is in his faithfulness. I am
fully prepared to allow the shy young man that virtue: he is constant in
his love. But the reason is not far to seek. The fact is it exhausts
all his stock of courage to look one woman in the face, and it would
be simply impossible for him to go through the ordeal with a second.
He stands in far too much dread of the whole female sex to want to go
gadding about with many of them. One is quite enough for him.

Now, it is different with the young man who is not shy. He has
temptations which his bashful brother never encounters. He looks around
and everywhere sees roguish eyes and laughing lips. What more natural
than that amid so many roguish eyes and laughing lips he should become
confused and, forgetting for the moment which particular pair of roguish
ayes and laughing lips it is that he belongs to, go off making love
to the wrong set. The shy man, who never looks at anything but his own
boots, sees not and is not tempted. Happy shy man!

Not but what the shy man himself would much rather not be happy in that
way. He longs to "go it" with the others, and curses himself every day
for not being able to. He will now and again, screwing up his courage
by a tremendous effort, plunge into roguishness. But it is always a
terrible _fiasco_, and after one or two feeble flounders he crawls out
again, limp and pitiable.

I say "pitiable," though I am afraid he never is pitied. There are
certain misfortunes which, while inflicting a vast amount of suffering
upon their victims, gain for them no sympathy. Losing an umbrella,
falling in love, toothache, black eyes, and having your hat sat upon may
be mentioned as a few examples, but the chief of them all is shyness.
The shy man is regarded as an animate joke. His tortures are the sport
of the drawing-room arena and are pointed out and discussed with much
gusto.

"Look," cry his tittering audience to each other; "he's blushing!"

"Just watch his legs," says one.

"Do you notice how he is sitting?" adds another: "right on the edge of
the chair."

"Seems to have plenty of color," sneers a military-looking gentleman.

"Pity he's got so many hands," murmurs an elderly lady, with her own
calmly folded on her lap. "They quite confuse him."

"A yard or two off his feet wouldn't be a disadvantage," chimes in the
comic man, "especially as he seems so anxious to hide them."

And then another suggests that with such a voice he ought to have been
a sea-captain. Some draw attention to the desperate way in which he is
grasping his hat. Some comment upon his limited powers of conversation.
Others remark upon the troublesome nature of his cough. And so on, until
his peculiarities and the company are both thoroughly exhausted.

His friends and relations make matters still more unpleasant for the
poor boy (friends and relations are privileged to be more disagreeable
than other people). Not content with making fun of him among themselves,
they insist on his seeing the joke. They mimic and caricature him for
his own edification. One, pretending to imitate him, goes outside
and comes in again in a ludicrously nervous manner, explaining to him
afterward that that is the way he--meaning the shy fellow--walks into
a room; or, turning to him with "This is the way you shake hands,"
proceeds to go through a comic pantomime with the rest of the room,
taking hold of every one's hand as if it were a hot plate and flabbily
dropping it again. And then they ask him why he blushes, and why he
stammers, and why he always speaks in an almost inaudible tone, as if
they thought he did it on purpose. Then one of them, sticking out his
chest and strutting about the room like a pouter-pigeon, suggests quite
seriously that that is the style he should adopt. The old man slaps him
on the back and says: "Be bold, my boy. Don't be afraid of any one." The
mother says, "Never do anything that you need be ashamed of, Algernon,
and then you never need be ashamed of anything you do," and, beaming
mildly at him, seems surprised at the clearness of her own logic. The
boys tell him that he's "worse than a girl," and the girls repudiate the
implied slur upon their sex by indignantly exclaiming that they are sure
no girl would be half as bad.

They are quite right; no girl would be. There is no such thing as a shy
woman, or, at all events, I have never come across one, and until I do I
shall not believe in them. I know that the generally accepted belief
is quite the reverse. All women are supposed to be like timid, startled
fawns, blushing and casting down their gentle eyes when looked at and
running away when spoken to; while we men are supposed to be a bold and
rollicky lot, and the poor dear little women admire us for it, but are
terribly afraid of us. It is a pretty theory, but, like most generally
accepted theories, mere nonsense. The girl of twelve is self-contained
and as cool as the proverbial cucumber, while her brother of twenty
stammers and stutters by her side. A woman will enter a concert-room
late, interrupt the performance, and disturb the whole audience
without moving a hair, while her husband follows her, a crushed heap of
apologizing misery.

The superior nerve of women in all matters connected with love, from the
casting of the first sheep's-eye down to the end of the honeymoon, is
too well acknowledged to need comment. Nor is the example a fair one to
cite in the present instance, the positions not being equally balanced.
Love is woman's business, and in "business" we all lay aside our natural
weaknesses--the shyest man I ever knew was a photographic tout.




ON BABIES.

Oh, yes, I do--I know a lot about 'em. I was one myself once, though not
long--not so long as my clothes. They were very long, I recollect, and
always in my way when I wanted to kick. Why do babies have such yards of
unnecessary clothing? It is not a riddle. I really want to know. I never
could understand it. Is it that the parents are ashamed of the size of
the child and wish to make believe that it is longer than it actually
is? I asked a nurse once why it was. She said:

"Lor', sir, they always have long clothes, bless their little hearts."

And when I explained that her answer, although doing credit to her
feelings, hardly disposed of my difficulty, she replied:

"Lor', sir, you wouldn't have 'em in short clothes, poor little dears?"
And she said it in a tone that seemed to imply I had suggested some
unmanly outrage.

Since than I have felt shy at making inquiries on the subject, and
the reason--if reason there be--is still a mystery to me. But indeed,
putting them in any clothes at all seems absurd to my mind. Goodness
knows there is enough of dressing and undressing to be gone through
in life without beginning it before we need; and one would think that
people who live in bed might at all events be spared the torture. Why
wake the poor little wretches up in the morning to take one lot of
clothes off, fix another lot on, and put them to bed again, and then
at night haul them out once more, merely to change everything back?
And when all is done, what difference is there, I should like to know,
between a baby's night-shirt and the thing it wears in the day-time?

Very likely, however, I am only making myself ridiculous--I often do,
so I am informed--and I will therefore say no more upon this matter
of clothes, except only that it would be of great convenience if some
fashion were adopted enabling you to tell a boy from a girl.

At present it is most awkward. Neither hair, dress, nor conversation
affords the slightest clew, and you are left to guess. By some
mysterious law of nature you invariably guess wrong, and are thereupon
regarded by all the relatives and friends as a mixture of fool and
knave, the enormity of alluding to a male babe as "she" being only
equaled by the atrocity of referring to a female infant as "he".
Whichever sex the particular child in question happens not to belong to
is considered as beneath contempt, and any mention of it is taken as a
personal insult to the family.

And as you value your fair name do not attempt to get out of the
difficulty by talking of "it."

There are various methods by which you may achieve ignominy and shame.
By murdering a large and respected family in cold blood and afterward
depositing their bodies in the water companies' reservoir, you will gain
much unpopularity in the neighborhood of your crime, and even robbing a
church will get you cordially disliked, especially by the vicar. But
if you desire to drain to the dregs the fullest cup of scorn and hatred
that a fellow human creature can pour out for you, let a young mother
hear you call dear baby "it."

Your best plan is to address the article as "little angel." The noun
"angel" being of common gender suits the case admirably, and the epithet
is sure of being favorably received. "Pet" or "beauty" are useful for
variety's sake, but "angel" is the term that brings you the greatest
credit for sense and good-feeling. The word should be preceded by a
short giggle and accompanied by as much smile as possible. And whatever
you do, don't forget to say that the child has got its father's nose.
This "fetches" the parents (if I may be allowed a vulgarism) more than
anything. They will pretend to laugh at the idea at first and will say,
"Oh, nonsense!" You must then get excited and insist that it is a fact.
You need have no conscientious scruples on the subject, because the
thing's nose really does resemble its father's--at all events quite as
much as it does anything else in nature--being, as it is, a mere smudge.

Do not despise these hints, my friends. There may come a time when,
with mamma on one side and grand mamma on the other, a group of admiring
young ladies (not admiring you, though) behind, and a bald-headed dab of
humanity in front, you will be extremely thankful for some idea of
what to say. A man--an unmarried man, that is--is never seen to such
disadvantage as when undergoing the ordeal of "seeing baby." A cold
shudder runs down his back at the bare proposal, and the sickly smile
with which he says how delighted he shall be ought surely to move even
a mother's heart, unless, as I am inclined to believe, the whole
proceeding is a mere device adopted by wives to discourage the visits of
bachelor friends.

It is a cruel trick, though, whatever its excuse may be. The bell is
rung and somebody sent to tell nurse to bring baby down. This is the
signal for all the females present to commence talking "baby," during
which time you are left to your own sad thoughts and the speculations
upon the practicability of suddenly recollecting an important
engagement, and the likelihood of your being believed if you do.
Just when you have concocted an absurdly implausible tale about a
man outside, the door opens, and a tall, severe-looking woman enters,
carrying what at first sight appears to be a particularly skinny
bolster, with the feathers all at one end. Instinct, however, tells
you that this is the baby, and you rise with a miserable attempt at
appearing eager. When the first gush of feminine enthusiasm with which
the object in question is received has died out, and the number of
ladies talking at once has been reduced to the ordinary four or five,
the circle of fluttering petticoats divides, and room is made for you
to step forward. This you do with much the same air that you would walk
into the dock at Bow Street, and then, feeling unutterably miserable,
you stand solemnly staring at the child. There is dead silence, and you
know that every one is waiting for you to speak. You try to think
of something to say, but find, to your horror, that your reasoning
faculties have left you. It is a moment of despair, and your evil
genius, seizing the opportunity, suggests to you some of the most
idiotic remarks that it is possible for a human being to perpetrate.
Glancing round with an imbecile smile, you sniggeringly observe that "it
hasn't got much hair has it?" Nobody answers you for a minute, but at
last the stately nurse says with much gravity:

"It is not customary for children five weeks old to have long hair."
Another silence follows this, and you feel you are being given a second
chance, which you avail yourself of by inquiring if it can walk yet, or
what they feed it on.

By this time you have got to be regarded as not quite right in your
head, and pity is the only thing felt for you. The nurse, however, is
determined that, insane or not, there shall be no shirking and that you
shall go through your task to the end. In the tones of a high priestess
directing some religious mystery she says, holding the bundle toward
you:

"Take her in your arms, sir." You are too crushed to offer any
resistance and so meekly accept the burden. "Put your arm more down her
middle, sir," says the high-priestess, and then all step back and watch
you intently as though you were going to do a trick with it.

What to do you know no more than you did what to say. It is certain
something must be done, and the only thing that occurs to you is
to heave the unhappy infant up and down to the accompaniment of
"oopsee-daisy," or some remark of equal intelligence. "I wouldn't jig
her, sir, if I were you," says the nurse; "a very little upsets her."
You promptly decide not to jig her and sincerely hope that you have not
gone too far already.

At this point the child itself, who has hitherto been regarding you with
an expression of mingled horror and disgust, puts an end to the nonsense
by beginning to yell at the top of its voice, at which the priestess
rushes forward and snatches it from you with "There! there! there!
What did ums do to ums?" "How very extraordinary!" you say pleasantly.
"Whatever made it go off like that?" "Oh, why, you must have done
something to her!" says the mother indignantly; "the child wouldn't
scream like that for nothing." It is evident they think you have been
running pins into it.

The brat is calmed at last, and would no doubt remain quiet enough, only
some mischievous busybody points you out again with "Who's this, baby?"
and the intelligent child, recognizing you, howls louder than ever.

Whereupon some fat old lady remarks that "it's strange how children take
a dislike to any one." "Oh, they know," replies another mysteriously.
"It's a wonderful thing," adds a third; and then everybody looks
sideways at you, convinced you are a scoundrel of the blackest dye; and
they glory in the beautiful idea that your true character, unguessed
by your fellow-men, has been discovered by the untaught instinct of a
little child.

Babies, though, with all their crimes and errors, are not without their
use--not without use, surely, when they fill an empty heart; not without
use when, at their call, sunbeams of love break through care-clouded
faces; not without use when their little fingers press wrinkles into
smiles.

Odd little people! They are the unconscious comedians of the world's
great stage. They supply the humor in life's all-too-heavy drama.
Each one, a small but determined opposition to the order of things in
general, is forever doing the wrong thing at the wrong time, in the
wrong place and in the wrong way. The nurse-girl who sent Jenny to
see what Tommy and Totty were doing and "tell 'em they mustn't" knew
infantile nature. Give an average baby a fair chance, and if it doesn't
do something it oughtn't to a doctor should be called in at once.

They have a genius for doing the most ridiculous things, and they do
them in a grave, stoical manner that is irresistible. The business-like
air with which two of them will join hands and proceed due east at a
break-neck toddle, while an excitable big sister is roaring for them to
follow her in a westerly direction, is most amusing--except, perhaps,
for the big sister. They walk round a soldier, staring at his legs with
the greatest curiosity, and poke him to see if he is real. They stoutly
maintain, against all argument and much to the discomfort of the victim,
that the bashful young man at the end of the 'bus is "dadda." A crowded
street-corner suggests itself to their minds as a favorable spot for the
discussion of family affairs at a shrill treble. When in the middle of
crossing the road they are seized with a sudden impulse to dance, and
the doorstep of a busy shop is the place they always select for sitting
down and taking off their shoes.

When at home they find the biggest walking-stick in the house or an
umbrella--open preferred-of much assistance in getting upstairs.
They discover that they love Mary Ann at the precise moment when that
faithful domestic is blackleading the stove, and nothing will relieve
their feelings but to embrace her then and there. With regard to food,
their favorite dishes are coke and cat's meat. They nurse pussy upside
down, and they show their affection for the dog by pulling his tail.

They are a deal of trouble, and they make a place untidy and they cost
a lot of money to keep; but still you would not have the house without
them. It would not be home without their noisy tongues and their
mischief-making hands. Would not the rooms seem silent without their
pattering feet, and might not you stray apart if no prattling voices
called you together?

It should be so, and yet I have sometimes thought the tiny hand seemed
as a wedge, dividing. It is a bearish task to quarrel with that purest
of all human affections--that perfecting touch to a woman's life--a
mother's love. It is a holy love, that we coarser-fibered men can hardly
understand, and I would not be deemed to lack reverence for it when I
say that surely it need not swallow up all other affection. The baby
need not take your whole heart, like the rich man who walled up the
desert well. Is there not another thirsty traveler standing by?

In your desire to be a good mother, do not forget to be a good wife. No
need for all the thought and care to be only for one. Do not, whenever
poor Edwin wants you to come out, answer indignantly, "What, and leave
baby!" Do not spend all your evenings upstairs, and do not confine your
conversation exclusively to whooping-cough and measles. My dear little
woman, the child is not going to die every time it sneezes, the house is
not bound to get burned down and the nurse run away with a soldier every
time you go outside the front door; nor the cat sure to come and sit on
the precious child's chest the moment you leave the bedside. You worry
yourself a good deal too much about that solitary chick, and you worry
everybody else too. Try and think of your other duties, and your pretty
face will not be always puckered into wrinkles, and there will be
cheerfulness in the parlor as well as in the nursery. Think of your big
baby a little. Dance him about a bit; call him pretty names; laugh at
him now and then. It is only the first baby that takes up the whole of
a woman's time. Five or six do not require nearly so much attention as
one. But before then the mischief has been done. A house where there
seems no room for him and a wife too busy to think of him have lost
their hold on that so unreasonable husband of yours, and he has learned
to look elsewhere for comfort and companionship.

But there, there, there! I shall get myself the character of a
baby-hater if I talk any more in this strain. And Heaven knows I am not
one. Who could be, to look into the little innocent faces clustered
in timid helplessness round those great gates that open down into the
world?

The world--the small round world! what a vast mysterious place it must
seem to baby eyes! What a trackless continent the back garden appears!
What marvelous explorations they make in the cellar under the stairs!
With what awe they gaze down the long street, wondering, like us bigger
babies when we gaze up at the stars, where it all ends!

And down that longest street of all--that long, dim street of life that
stretches out before them--what grave, old-fashioned looks they seem
to cast! What pitiful, frightened looks sometimes! I saw a little mite
sitting on a doorstep in a Soho slum one night, and I shall never forget
the look that the gas-lamp showed me on its wizen face--a look of dull
despair, as if from the squalid court the vista of its own squalid life
had risen, ghostlike, and struck its heart dead with horror.

Poor little feet, just commencing the stony journey! We old travelers,
far down the road, can only pause to wave a hand to you. You come out of
the dark mist, and we, looking back, see you, so tiny in the distance,
standing on the brow of the hill, your arms stretched out toward us.
God speed you! We would stay and take your little hands in ours, but the
murmur of the great sea is in our ears and we may not linger. We must
hasten down, for the shadowy ships are waiting to spread their sable
sails.




ON EATING AND DRINKING.

I always was fond of eating and drinking, even as a child--especially
eating, in those early days. I had an appetite then, also a digestion. I
remember a dull-eyed, livid-complexioned gentleman coming to dine at
our house once. He watched me eating for about five minutes, quite
fascinated seemingly, and then he turned to my father with--

"Does your boy ever suffer from dyspepsia?"

"I never heard him complain of anything of that kind," replied my
father. "Do you ever suffer from dyspepsia, Colly wobbles?" (They called
me Colly wobbles, but it was not my real name.)

"No, pa," I answered. After which I added:

"What is dyspepsia, pa?"

My livid-complexioned friend regarded me with a look of mingled
amazement and envy. Then in a tone of infinite pity he slowly said:

"You will know--some day."

My poor, dear mother used to say she liked to see me eat, and it has
always been a pleasant reflection to me since that I must have given
her much gratification in that direction. A growing, healthy lad, taking
plenty of exercise and careful to restrain himself from indulging in
too much study, can generally satisfy the most exacting expectations as
regards his feeding powers.

It is amusing to see boys eat when you have not got to pay for it. Their
idea of a square meal is a pound and a half of roast beef with five
or six good-sized potatoes (soapy ones preferred as being more
substantial), plenty of greens, and four thick slices of Yorkshire
pudding, followed by a couple of currant dumplings, a few green apples,
a pen'orth of nuts, half a dozen jumbles, and a bottle of ginger-beer.
After that they play at horses.

How they must despise us men, who require to sit quiet for a couple
of hours after dining off a spoonful of clear soup and the wing of a
chicken!

But the boys have not all the advantages on their side. A boy never
enjoys the luxury of being satisfied. A boy never feels full. He can
never stretch out his legs, put his hands behind his head, and, closing
his eyes, sink into the ethereal blissfulness that encompasses the
well-dined man. A dinner makes no difference whatever to a boy. To a
man it is as a good fairy's potion, and after it the world appears
a brighter and a better place. A man who has dined satisfactorily
experiences a yearning love toward all his fellow-creatures. He strokes
the cat quite gently and calls it "poor pussy," in tones full of the
tenderest emotion. He sympathizes with the members of the German band
outside and wonders if they are cold; and for the moment he does not
even hate his wife's relations.

A good dinner brings out all the softer side of a man. Under its genial
influence the gloomy and morose become jovial and chatty. Sour, starchy
individuals, who all the rest of the day go about looking as if they
lived on vinegar and Epsom salts, break out into wreathed smiles after
dinner, and exhibit a tendency to pat small children on the head and
to talk to them--vaguely--about sixpences. Serious men thaw and become
mildly cheerful, and snobbish young men of the heavy-mustache type
forget to make themselves objectionable.

I always feel sentimental myself after dinner. It is the only time when
I can properly appreciate love-stories. Then, when the hero clasps "her"
to his heart in one last wild embrace and stifles a sob, I feel as sad
as though I had dealt at whist and turned up only a deuce; and when the
heroine dies in the end I weep. If I read the same tale early in the
morning I should sneer at it. Digestion, or rather indigestion, has
a marvelous effect upon the heart. If I want to write any thing very
pathetic--I mean, if I want to try to write anything very pathetic--I
eat a large plateful of hot buttered muffins about an hour beforehand,
and then by the time I sit down to my work a feeling of unutterable
melancholy has come over me. I picture heartbroken lovers parting
forever at lonely wayside stiles, while the sad twilight deepens
around them, and only the tinkling of a distant sheep-bell breaks the
sorrow-laden silence. Old men sit and gaze at withered flowers till
their sight is dimmed by the mist of tears. Little dainty maidens wait
and watch at open casements; but "he cometh not," and the heavy years
roll by and the sunny gold tresses wear white and thin. The babies that
they dandled have become grown men and women with podgy torments of
their own, and the playmates that they laughed with are lying very
silent under the waving grass. But still they wait and watch, till the
dark shadows of the unknown night steal up and gather round them and the
world with its childish troubles fades from their aching eyes.

I see pale corpses tossed on white-foamed waves, and death-beds stained
with bitter tears, and graves in trackless deserts. I hear the wild
wailing of women, the low moaning of little children, the dry sobbing of
strong men. It's all the muffins. I could not conjure up one melancholy
fancy upon a mutton chop and a glass of champagne.

A full stomach is a great aid to poetry, and indeed no sentiment of any
kind can stand upon an empty one. We have not time or inclination
to indulge in fanciful troubles until we have got rid of our real
misfortunes. We do not sigh over dead dicky-birds with the bailiff
in the house, and when we do not know where on earth to get our next
shilling from, we do not worry as to whether our mistress' smiles are
cold, or hot, or lukewarm, or anything else about them.

Foolish people--when I say "foolish people" in this contemptuous way I
mean people who entertain different opinions to mine. If there is one
person I do despise more than another, it is the man who does not think
exactly the same on all topics as I do--foolish people, I say, then,
who have never experienced much of either, will tell you that mental
distress is far more agonizing than bodily. Romantic and touching
theory! so comforting to the love-sick young sprig who looks down
patronizingly at some poor devil with a white starved face and thinks to
himself, "Ah, how happy you are compared with me!"--so soothing to fat
old gentlemen who cackle about the superiority of poverty over riches.
But it is all nonsense--all cant. An aching head soon makes one forget
an aching heart. A broken finger will drive away all recollections of
an empty chair. And when a man feels really hungry he does not feel
anything else.

We sleek, well-fed folk can hardly realize what feeling hungry is like.
We know what it is to have no appetite and not to care for the dainty
victuals placed before us, but we do not understand what it means to
sicken for food--to die for bread while others waste it--to gaze with
famished eyes upon coarse fare steaming behind dingy windows, longing
for a pen'orth of pea pudding and not having the penny to buy it--to
feel that a crust would be delicious and that a bone would be a banquet.

Hunger is a luxury to us, a piquant, flavor-giving sauce. It is well
worth while to get hungry and thirsty merely to discover how much
gratification can be obtained from eating and drinking. If you wish
to thoroughly enjoy your dinner, take a thirty-mile country walk after
breakfast and don't touch anything till you get back. How your eyes will
glisten at sight of the white table-cloth and steaming dishes then! With
what a sigh of content you will put down the empty beer tankard and take
up your knife and fork! And how comfortable you feel afterward as you
push back your chair, light a cigar, and beam round upon everybody.

Make sure, however, when adopting this plan, that the good dinner is
really to be had at the end, or the disappointment is trying. I remember
once a friend and I--dear old Joe, it was. Ah! how we lose one another
in life's mist. It must be eight years since I last saw Joseph Taboys.
How pleasant it would be to meet his jovial face again, to clasp his
strong hand, and to hear his cheery laugh once more! He owes me 14
shillings, too. Well, we were on a holiday together, and one morning
we had breakfast early and started for a tremendous long walk. We had
ordered a duck for dinner over night. We said, "Get a big one, because
we shall come home awfully hungry;" and as we were going out our
landlady came up in great spirits. She said, "I have got you gentlemen a
duck, if you like. If you get through that you'll do well;" and she held
up a bird about the size of a door-mat. We chuckled at the sight and
said we would try. We said it with self-conscious pride, like men who
know their own power. Then we started.

We lost our way, of course. I always do in the country, and it does make
me so wild, because it is no use asking direction of any of the people
you meet. One might as well inquire of a lodging-house slavey the way
to make beds as expect a country bumpkin to know the road to the next
village. You have to shout the question about three times before the
sound of your voice penetrates his skull. At the third time he slowly
raises his head and stares blankly at you. You yell it at him then for
a fourth time, and he repeats it after you. He ponders while you count
a couple of hundred, after which, speaking at the rate of three words a
minute, he fancies you "couldn't do better than--" Here he catches
sight of another idiot coming down the road and bawls out to him the
particulars, requesting his advice. The two then argue the case for
a quarter of an hour or so, and finally agree that you had better go
straight down the lane, round to the right and cross by the third stile,
and keep to the left by old Jimmy Milcher's cow-shed, and across the
seven-acre field, and through the gate by Squire Grubbin's hay-stack,
keeping the bridle-path for awhile till you come opposite the hill where
the windmill used to be--but it's gone now--and round to the right,
leaving Stiggin's plantation behind you; and you say "Thank you" and go
away with a splitting headache, but without the faintest notion of your
way, the only clear idea you have on the subject being that somewhere
or other there is a stile which has to be got over; and at the next turn
you come upon four stiles, all leading in different directions!

We had undergone this ordeal two or three times. We had tramped over
fields. We had waded through brooks and scrambled over hedges and walls.
We had had a row as to whose fault it was that we had first lost our
way. We had got thoroughly disagreeable, footsore, and weary. But
throughout it all the hope of that duck kept us up. A fairy-like vision,
it floated before our tired eyes and drew us onward. The thought of it
was as a trumpet-call to the fainting. We talked of it and cheered each
other with our recollections of it. "Come along," we said; "the duck
will be spoiled."

We felt a strong temptation, at one point, to turn into a village inn
as we passed and have a cheese and a few loaves between us, but we
heroically restrained ourselves: we should enjoy the duck all the better
for being famished.

We fancied we smelled it when we go into the town and did the last
quarter of a mile in three minutes. We rushed upstairs, and washed
ourselves, and changed our clothes, and came down, and pulled our chairs
up to the table, and sat and rubbed our hands while the landlady removed
the covers, when I seized the knife and fork and started to carve.

It seemed to want a lot of carving. I struggled with it for about five
minutes without making the slightest impression, and then Joe, who had
been eating potatoes, wanted to know if it wouldn't be better for some
one to do the job that understood carving. I took no notice of his
foolish remark, but attacked the bird again; and so vigorously this time
that the animal left the dish and took refuge in the fender.

We soon had it out of that, though, and I was prepared to make another
effort. But Joe was getting unpleasant. He said that if he had thought
we were to have a game of blind hockey with the dinner he would have got
a bit of bread and cheese outside.

I was too exhausted to argue. I laid down the knife and fork with
dignity and took a side seat and Joe went for the wretched creature. He
worked away in silence for awhile, and then he muttered "Damn the duck"
and took his coat off.

We did break the thing up at length with the aid of a chisel, but it
was perfectly impossible to eat it, and we had to make a dinner off the
vegetables and an apple tart. We tried a mouthful of the duck, but it
was like eating India-rubber.

It was a wicked sin to kill that drake. But there! there's no respect
for old institutions in this country.

I started this paper with the idea of writing about eating and drinking,
but I seem to have confined my remarks entirely to eating as yet. Well,
you see, drinking is one of those subjects with which it is inadvisable
to appear too well acquainted. The days are gone by when it was
considered manly to go to bed intoxicated every night, and a clear head
and a firm hand no longer draw down upon their owner the reproach
of effeminacy. On the contrary, in these sadly degenerate days an
evil-smelling breath, a blotchy face, a reeling gait, and a husky voice
are regarded as the hall marks of the cad rather than or the gentleman.

Even nowadays, though, the thirstiness of mankind is something
supernatural. We are forever drinking on one excuse or another. A man
never feels comfortable unless he has a glass before him. We drink
before meals, and with meals, and after meals. We drink when we meet a
friend, also when we part from a friend. We drink when we are talking,
when we are reading, and when we are thinking. We drink one another's
healths and spoil our own. We drink the queen, and the army, and the
ladies, and everybody else that is drinkable; and I believe if the
supply ran short we should drink our mothers-in-law.

By the way, we never eat anybody's health, always drink it. Why should
we not stand up now and then and eat a tart to somebody's success?

To me, I confess the constant necessity of drinking under which the
majority of men labor is quite unaccountable. I can understand people
drinking to drown care or to drive away maddening thoughts well enough.
I can understand the ignorant masses loving to soak themselves in
drink--oh, yes, it's very shocking that they should, of course--very
shocking to us who live in cozy homes, with all the graces and pleasures
of life around us, that the dwellers in damp cellars and windy attics
should creep from their dens of misery into the warmth and glare of the
public-house bar, and seek to float for a brief space away from their
dull world upon a Lethe stream of gin.

But think, before you hold up your hands in horror at their ill-living,
what "life" for these wretched creatures really means. Picture the
squalid misery of their brutish existence, dragged on from year to year
in the narrow, noisome room where, huddled like vermin in sewers, they
welter, and sicken, and sleep; where dirt-grimed children scream and
fight and sluttish, shrill-voiced women cuff, and curse, and nag; where
the street outside teems with roaring filth and the house around is a
bedlam of riot and stench.

Think what a sapless stick this fair flower of life must be to them,
devoid of mind and soul. The horse in his stall scents the sweet hay and
munches the ripe corn contentedly. The watch-dog in his kennel blinks at
the grateful sun, dreams of a glorious chase over the dewy fields,
and wakes with a yelp of gladness to greet a caressing hand. But the
clod-like life of these human logs never knows one ray of light. From
the hour when they crawl from their comfortless bed to the hour when
they lounge back into it again they never live one moment of real life.
Recreation, amusement, companionship, they know not the meaning of. Joy,
sorrow, laughter, tears, love, friendship, longing, despair, are idle
words to them. From the day when their baby eyes first look out upon
their sordid world to the day when, with an oath, they close them
forever and their bones are shoveled out of sight, they never warm to
one touch of human sympathy, never thrill to a single thought, never
start to a single hope. In the name of the God of mercy; let them pour
the maddening liquor down their throats and feel for one brief moment
that they live!

Ah! we may talk sentiment as much as we like, but the stomach is the
real seat of happiness in this world. The kitchen is the chief temple
wherein we worship, its roaring fire is our vestal flame, and the cook
is our great high-priest. He is a mighty magician and a kindly one. He
soothes away all sorrow and care. He drives forth all enmity, gladdens
all love. Our God is great and the cook is his prophet. Let us eat,
drink, and be merry.




ON FURNISHED APARTMENTS.

"Oh, you have some rooms to let."

"Mother!"

"Well, what is it?"

"'Ere's a gentleman about the rooms."

"Ask 'im in. I'll be up in a minute."

"Will yer step inside, sir? Mother'll be up in a minute."

So you step inside and after a minute "mother" comes slowly up the
kitchen stairs, untying her apron as she comes and calling down
instructions to some one below about the potatoes.

"Good-morning, sir," says "mother," with a washed-out smile. "Will you
step this way, please?"

"Oh, it's hardly worth while my coming up," you say. "What sort of rooms
are they, and how much?"

"Well," says the landlady, "if you'll step upstairs I'll show them to
you."

So with a protesting murmur, meant to imply that any waste of time
complained of hereafter must not be laid to your charge, you follow
"mother" upstairs.

At the first landing you run up against a pail and a broom, whereupon
"mother" expatiates upon the unreliability of servant-girls, and bawls
over the balusters for Sarah to come and take them away at once. When
you get outside the rooms she pauses, with her hand upon the door, to
explain to you that they are rather untidy just at present, as the
last lodger left only yesterday; and she also adds that this is their
cleaning-day--it always is. With this understanding you enter, and both
stand solemnly feasting your eyes upon the scene before you. The rooms
cannot be said to appear inviting. Even "mother's" face betrays no
admiration. Untenanted "furnished apartments" viewed in the morning
sunlight do not inspire cheery sensations. There is a lifeless air about
them. It is a very different thing when you have settled down and are
living in them. With your old familiar household gods to greet your gaze
whenever you glance up, and all your little knick-knacks spread around
you--with the photos of all the girls that you have loved and lost
ranged upon the mantel-piece, and half a dozen disreputable-looking
pipes scattered about in painfully prominent positions--with one carpet
slipper peeping from beneath the coal-box and the other perched on the
top of the piano--with the well-known pictures to hide the dingy walls,
and these dear old friends, your books, higgledy-piggledy all over the
place--with the bits of old blue china that your mother prized, and the
screen she worked in those far by-gone days, when the sweet old face was
laughing and young, and the white soft hair tumbled in gold-brown curls
from under the coal-scuttle bonnet--

Ah, old screen, what a gorgeous personage you must have been in your
young days, when the tulips and roses and lilies (all growing from one
stem) were fresh in their glistening sheen! Many a summer and winter
have come and gone since then, my friend, and you have played with the
dancing firelight until you have grown sad and gray. Your brilliant
colors are fast fading now, and the envious moths have gnawed your
silken threads. You are withering away like the dead hands that wove
you. Do you ever think of those dead hands? You seem so grave and
thoughtful sometimes that I almost think you do. Come, you and I and
the deep-glowing embers, let us talk together. Tell me in your silent
language what you remember of those young days, when you lay on my
little mother's lap and her girlish fingers played with your rainbow
tresses. Was there never a lad near sometimes--never a lad who would
seize one of those little hands to smother it with kisses, and who would
persist in holding it, thereby sadly interfering with the progress of
your making? Was not your frail existence often put in jeopardy by this
same clumsy, headstrong lad, who would toss you disrespectfully aside
that he--not satisfied with one--might hold both hands and gaze up
into the loved eyes? I can see that lad now through the haze of the
flickering twilight. He is an eager bright-eyed boy, with pinching,
dandy shoes and tight-fitting smalls, snowy shirt frill and stock,
and--oh! such curly hair. A wild, light-hearted boy! Can he be the
great, grave gentleman upon whose stick I used to ride crosslegged, the
care-worn man into whose thoughtful face I used to gaze with childish
reverence and whom I used to call "father?" You say "yes," old screen;
but are you quite sure? It is a serious charge you are bringing. Can
it be possible? Did he have to kneel down in those wonderful smalls and
pick you up and rearrange you before he was forgiven and his curly head
smoothed by my mother's little hand? Ah! old screen, and did the lads
and the lassies go making love fifty years ago just as they do now? Are
men and women so unchanged? Did little maidens' hearts beat the same
under pearl-embroidered bodices as they do under Mother Hubbard cloaks?
Have steel casques and chimney-pot hats made no difference to the brains
that work beneath them? Oh, Time! great Chronos! and is this your power?
Have you dried up seas and leveled mountains and left the tiny human
heart-strings to defy you? Ah, yes! they were spun by a Mightier than
thou, and they stretch beyond your narrow ken, for their ends are made
fast in eternity. Ay, you may mow down the leaves and the blossoms, but
the roots of life lie too deep for your sickle to sever. You refashion
Nature's garments, but you cannot vary by a jot the throbbings of her
pulse. The world rolls round obedient to your laws, but the heart of man
is not of your kingdom, for in its birthplace "a thousand years are but
as yesterday."

I am getting away, though, I fear, from my "furnished apartments," and
I hardly know how to get back. But I have some excuse for my meanderings
this time. It is a piece of old furniture that has led me astray, and
fancies gather, somehow, round old furniture, like moss around old
stones. One's chairs and tables get to be almost part of one's life and
to seem like quiet friends. What strange tales the wooden-headed old
fellows could tell did they but choose to speak! At what unsuspected
comedies and tragedies have they not assisted! What bitter tears have
been sobbed into that old sofa cushion! What passionate whisperings the
settee must have overheard!

New furniture has no charms for me compared with old. It is the old
things that we love--the old faces, the old books, the old jokes. New
furniture can make a palace, but it takes old furniture to make a home.
Not merely old in itself--lodging-house furniture generally is that--but
it must be old to us, old in associations and recollections. The
furniture of furnished apartments, however ancient it may be in reality,
is new to our eyes, and we feel as though we could never get on with it.
As, too, in the case of all fresh acquaintances, whether wooden or human
(and there is very little difference between the two species sometimes),
everything impresses you with its worst aspect. The knobby wood-work and
shiny horse-hair covering of the easy-chair suggest anything but ease.
The mirror is smoky. The curtains want washing. The carpet is frayed.
The table looks as if it would go over the instant anything was rested
on it. The grate is cheerless, the wall-paper hideous. The ceiling
appears to have had coffee spilt all over it, and the ornaments--well,
they are worse than the wallpaper.

There must surely be some special and secret manufactory for the
production of lodging-house ornaments. Precisely the same articles are
to be found at every lodging-house all over the kingdom, and they are
never seen anywhere else. There are the two--what do you call them? they
stand one at each end of the mantel-piece, where they are never safe,
and they are hung round with long triangular slips of glass that clank
against one another and make you nervous. In the commoner class of rooms
these works of art are supplemented by a couple of pieces of china which
might each be meant to represent a cow sitting upon its hind legs, or a
model of the temple of Diana at Ephesus, or a dog, or anything else
you like to fancy. Somewhere about the room you come across a
bilious-looking object, which at first you take to be a lump of dough
left about by one of the children, but which on scrutiny seems to
resemble an underdone cupid. This thing the landlady calls a statue.
Then there is a "sampler" worked by some idiot related to the family, a
picture of the "Huguenots," two or three Scripture texts, and a highly
framed and glazed certificate to the effect that the father has been
vaccinated, or is an Odd Fellow, or something of that sort.

You examine these various attractions and then dismally ask what the
rent is.

"That's rather a good deal," you say on hearing the figure.

"Well, to tell you the truth," answers the landlady with a sudden burst
of candor, "I've always had" (mentioning a sum a good deal in excess
of the first-named amount), "and before that I used to have" (a still
higher figure).

What the rent of apartments must have been twenty years ago makes one
shudder to think of. Every landlady makes you feel thoroughly ashamed of
yourself by informing you, whenever the subject crops up, that she used
to get twice as much for her rooms as you are paying. Young men lodgers
of the last generation must have been of a wealthier class than they are
now, or they must have ruined themselves. I should have had to live in
an attic.

Curious, that in lodgings the rule of life is reversed. The higher you
get up in the world the lower you come down in your lodgings. On
the lodging-house ladder the poor man is at the top, the rich man
underneath. You start in the attic and work your way down to the first
floor.

A good many great men have lived in attics and some have died there.
Attics, says the dictionary, are "places where lumber is stored," and
the world has used them to store a good deal of its lumber in at one
time or another. Its preachers and painters and poets, its deep-browed
men who will find out things, its fire-eyed men who will tell truths
that no one wants to hear--these are the lumber that the world hides
away in its attics. Haydn grew up in an attic and Chatterton starved in
one. Addison and Goldsmith wrote in garrets. Faraday and De Quincey knew
them well. Dr. Johnson camped cheerfully in them, sleeping soundly--too
soundly sometimes--upon their trundle-beds, like the sturdy old soldier
of fortune that he was, inured to hardship and all careless of himself.
Dickens spent his youth among them, Morland his old age--alas! a
drunken, premature old age. Hans Andersen, the fairy king, dreamed his
sweet fancies beneath their sloping roofs. Poor, wayward-hearted Collins
leaned his head upon their crazy tables; priggish Benjamin Franklin;
Savage, the wrong-headed, much troubled when he could afford any softer
bed than a doorstep; young Bloomfield, "Bobby" Burns, Hogarth, Watts the
engineer--the roll is endless. Ever since the habitations of men were
reared two stories high has the garret been the nursery of genius.

No one who honors the aristocracy of mind can feel ashamed of
acquaintanceship with them. Their damp-stained walls are sacred to
the memory of noble names. If all the wisdom of the world and all its
art--all the spoils that it has won from nature, all the fire that it
has snatched from heaven--were gathered together and divided into heaps,
and we could point and say, for instance, these mighty truths were
flashed forth in the brilliant _salon_ amid the ripple of light laughter
and the sparkle of bright eyes; and this deep knowledge was dug up in
the quiet study, where the bust of Pallas looks serenely down on the
leather-scented shelves; and this heap belongs to the crowded street;
and that to the daisied field--the heap that would tower up high above
the rest as a mountain above hills would be the one at which we should
look up and say: this noblest pile of all--these glorious paintings and
this wondrous music, these trumpet words, these solemn thoughts, these
daring deeds, they were forged and fashioned amid misery and pain in the
sordid squalor of the city garret. There, from their eyries, while the
world heaved and throbbed below, the kings of men sent forth their
eagle thoughts to wing their flight through the ages. There, where the
sunlight streaming through the broken panes fell on rotting boards and
crumbling walls; there, from their lofty thrones, those rag-clothed
Joves have hurled their thunderbolts and shaken, before now, the earth
to its foundations.

Huddle them up in your lumber-rooms, oh, world! Shut them fast in and
turn the key of poverty upon them. Weld close the bars, and let them
fret their hero lives away within the narrow cage. Leave them there to
starve, and rot, and die. Laugh at the frenzied beatings of their hands
against the door. Roll onward in your dust and noise and pass them by,
forgotten.

But take care lest they turn and sting you. All do not, like the fabled
phoenix, warble sweet melodies in their agony; sometimes they spit
venom--venom you must breathe whether you will or no, for you cannot
seal their mouths, though you may fetter their limbs. You can lock the
door upon them, but they burst open their shaky lattices and call
out over the house-tops so that men cannot but hear. You hounded wild
Rousseau into the meanest garret of the Rue St. Jacques and jeered at
his angry shrieks. But the thin, piping tones swelled a hundred years
later into the sullen roar of the French Revolution, and civilization to
this day is quivering to the reverberations of his voice.

As for myself, however, I like an attic. Not to live in: as residences
they are inconvenient. There is too much getting up and down stairs
connected with them to please me. It puts one unpleasantly in mind of
the tread-mill. The form of the ceiling offers too many facilities for
bumping your head and too few for shaving. And the note of the tomcat
as he sings to his love in the stilly night outside on the tiles becomes
positively distasteful when heard so near.

No, for living in give me a suit of rooms on the first floor of a
Piccadilly mansion (I wish somebody would!); but for thinking in let
me have an attic up ten flights of stairs in the densest quarter of the
city. I have all Herr Teufelsdrockh's affection for attics. There is a
sublimity about their loftiness. I love to "sit at ease and look down
upon the wasps' nest beneath;" to listen to the dull murmur of the human
tide ebbing and flowing ceaselessly through the narrow streets and
lanes below. How small men seem, how like a swarm of ants sweltering in
endless confusion on their tiny hill! How petty seems the work on which
they are hurrying and skurrying! How childishly they jostle against
one another and turn to snarl and scratch! They jabber and screech and
curse, but their puny voices do not reach up here. They fret, and fume,
and rage, and pant, and die; "but I, mein Werther, sit above it all; I
am alone with the stars."

The most extraordinary attic I ever came across was one a friend and I
once shared many years ago. Of all eccentrically planned things, from
Bradshaw to the maze at Hampton Court, that room was the most eccentric.
The architect who designed it must have been a genius, though I cannot
help thinking that his talents would have been better employed in
contriving puzzles than in shaping human habitations. No figure in
Euclid could give any idea of that apartment. It contained seven
corners, two of the walls sloped to a point, and the window was just
over the fireplace. The only possible position for the bedstead was
between the door and the cupboard. To get anything out of the cupboard
we had to scramble over the bed, and a large percentage of the various
commodities thus obtained was absorbed by the bedclothes. Indeed, so
many things were spilled and dropped upon the bed that toward night-time
it had become a sort of small cooperative store. Coal was what it always
had most in stock. We used to keep our coal in the bottom part of the
cupboard, and when any was wanted we had to climb over the bed, fill
a shovelful, and then crawl back. It was an exciting moment when we
reached the middle of the bed. We would hold our breath, fix our eyes
upon the shovel, and poise ourselves for the last move. The next instant
we, and the coals, and the shovel, and the bed would be all mixed up
together.

I've heard of the people going into raptures over beds of coal. We slept
in one every night and were not in the least stuck up about it.

But our attic, unique though it was, had by no means exhausted the
architect's sense of humor. The arrangement of the whole house was a
marvel of originality. All the doors opened outward, so that if any
one wanted to leave a room at the same moment that you were coming
downstairs it was unpleasant for you. There was no ground-floor--its
ground-floor belonged to a house in the next court, and the front
door opened direct upon a flight of stairs leading down to the cellar.
Visitors on entering the house would suddenly shoot past the person who
had answered the door to them and disappear down these stairs. Those of
a nervous temperament used to imagine that it was a trap laid for them,
and would shout murder as they lay on their backs at the bottom till
somebody came and picked them up.

It is a long time ago now that I last saw the inside of an attic. I have
tried various floors since but I have not found that they have made much
difference to me. Life tastes much the same, whether we quaff it from a
golden goblet or drink it out of a stone mug. The hours come laden with
the same mixture of joy and sorrow, no matter where we wait for them. A
waistcoat of broadcloth or of fustian is alike to an aching heart, and
we laugh no merrier on velvet cushions than we did on wooden chairs.
Often have I sighed in those low-ceilinged rooms, yet disappointments
have come neither less nor lighter since I quitted them. Life works upon
a compensating balance, and the happiness we gain in one direction we
lose in another. As our means increase, so do our desires; and we ever
stand midway between the two. When we reside in an attic we enjoy a
supper of fried fish and stout. When we occupy the first floor it takes
an elaborate dinner at the Continental to give us the same amount of
satisfaction.




ON DRESS AND DEPORTMENT.

They say--people who ought to be ashamed of themselves do--that the
consciousness of being well dressed imparts a blissfulness to the human
heart that religion is powerless to bestow. I am afraid these cynical
persons are sometimes correct. I know that when I was a very young man
(many, many years ago, as the story-books say) and wanted cheering up,
I used to go and dress myself in all my best clothes. If I had been
annoyed in any manner--if my washerwoman had discharged me, for
instance; or my blank-verse poem had been returned for the tenth time,
with the editor's compliments "and regrets that owing to want of space
he is unable to avail himself of kind offer;" or I had been snubbed by
the woman I loved as man never loved before--by the way, it's really
extraordinary what a variety of ways of loving there must be. We all do
it as it was never done before. I don't know how our great-grandchildren
will manage. They will have to do it on their heads by their time if
they persist in not clashing with any previous method.

Well, as I was saying, when these unpleasant sort of things happened and
I felt crushed, I put on all my best clothes and went out. It brought
back my vanishing self-esteem. In a glossy new hat and a pair of
trousers with a fold down the front (carefully preserved by keeping them
under the bed--I don't mean on the floor, you know, but between the
bed and the mattress), I felt I was somebody and that there were other
washerwomen: ay, and even other girls to love, and who would perhaps
appreciate a clever, good-looking young fellow. I didn't care; that
was my reckless way. I would make love to other maidens. I felt that in
those clothes I could do it.

They have a wonderful deal to do with courting, clothes have. It is half
the battle. At all events, the young man thinks so, and it generally
takes him a couple of hours to get himself up for the occasion. His
first half-hour is occupied in trying to decide whether to wear his
light suit with a cane and drab billycock, or his black tails with a
chimney-pot hat and his new umbrella. He is sure to be unfortunate in
either decision. If he wears his light suit and takes the stick it comes
on to rain, and he reaches the house in a damp and muddy condition and
spends the evening trying to hide his boots. If, on the other hand, he
decides in favor of the top hat and umbrella--nobody would ever dream
of going out in a top hat without an umbrella; it would be like letting
baby (bless it!) toddle out without its nurse. How I do hate a top
hat! One lasts me a very long while, I can tell you. I only wear it
when--well, never mind when I wear it. It lasts me a very long while.
I've had my present one five years. It was rather old-fashioned last
summer, but the shape has come round again now and I look quite stylish.

But to return to our young man and his courting. If he starts off with
the top hat and umbrella the afternoon turns out fearfully hot, and the
perspiration takes all the soap out of his mustache and converts the
beautifully arranged curl over his forehead into a limp wisp resembling
a lump of seaweed. The Fates are never favorable to the poor wretch. If
he does by any chance reach the door in proper condition, she has gone
out with her cousin and won't be back till late.

How a young lover made ridiculous by the gawkiness of modern costume
must envy the picturesque gallants of seventy years ago! Look at them
(on the Christmas cards), with their curly hair and natty hats, their
well-shaped legs incased in smalls, their dainty Hessian boots, their
ruffling frills, their canes and dangling seals. No wonder the little
maiden in the big poke-bonnet and the light-blue sash casts down her
eyes and is completely won. Men could win hearts in clothes like that.
But what can you expect from baggy trousers and a monkeyjacket?

Clothes have more effect upon us than we imagine. Our deportment depends
upon our dress. Make a man get into seedy, worn-out rags, and he will
skulk along with his head hanging down, like a man going out to fetch
his own supper beer. But deck out the same article in gorgeous raiment
and fine linen, and he will strut down the main thoroughfare, swinging
his cane and looking at the girls as perky as a bantam cock.

Clothes alter our very nature. A man could not help being fierce and
daring with a plume in his bonnet, a dagger in his belt, and a lot of
puffy white things all down his sleeves. But in an ulster he wants to
get behind a lamp-post and call police.

I am quite ready to admit that you can find sterling merit,
honest worth, deep affection, and all such like virtues of the
roast-beef-and-plum-pudding school as much, and perhaps more, under
broadcloth and tweed as ever existed beneath silk and velvet; but the
spirit of that knightly chivalry that "rode a tilt for lady's love" and
"fought for lady's smiles" needs the clatter of steel and the rustle of
plumes to summon it from its grave between the dusty folds of tapestry
and underneath the musty leaves of moldering chronicles.

The world must be getting old, I think; it dresses so very soberly now.
We have been through the infant period of humanity, when we used to run
about with nothing on but a long, loose robe, and liked to have our feet
bare. And then came the rough, barbaric age, the boyhood of our race. We
didn't care what we wore then, but thought it nice to tattoo ourselves
all over, and we never did our hair. And after that the world grew into
a young man and became foppish. It decked itself in flowing curls and
scarlet doublets, and went courting, and bragging, and bouncing--making
a brave show.

But all those merry, foolish days of youth are gone, and we are very
sober, very solemn--and very stupid, some say--now. The world is a
grave, middle-aged gentleman in this nineteenth century, and would be
shocked to see itself with a bit of finery on. So it dresses in black
coats and trousers, and black hats, and black boots, and, dear me, it
is such a very respectable gentleman--to think it could ever have gone
gadding about as a troubadour or a knight-errant, dressed in all those
fancy colors! Ah, well! we are more sensible in this age.

Or at least we think ourselves so. It is a general theory nowadays that
sense and dullness go together.

Goodness is another quality that always goes with blackness. Very good
people indeed, you will notice, dress altogether in black, even to
gloves and neckties, and they will probably take to black shirts before
long. Medium goods indulge in light trousers on week-days, and some
of them even go so far as to wear fancy waistcoats. On the other hand,
people who care nothing for a future state go about in light suits; and
there have been known wretches so abandoned as to wear a white hat. Such
people, however, are never spoken of in genteel society, and perhaps I
ought not to have referred to them here.

By the way, talking of light suits, have you ever noticed how people
stare at you the first time you go out in a new light suit They do
not notice it so much afterward. The population of London have got
accustomed to it by the third time you wear it. I say "you," because I
am not speaking from my own experience. I do not wear such things at all
myself. As I said, only sinful people do so.

I wish, though, it were not so, and that one could be good, and
respectable, and sensible without making one's self a guy. I look in
the glass sometimes at my two long, cylindrical bags (so picturesquely
rugged about the knees), my stand-up collar and billycock hat, and
wonder what right I have to go about making God's world hideous. Then
wild and wicked thoughts come into my heart. I don't want to be good and
respectable. (I never can be sensible, I'm told; so that don't matter.)
I want to put on lavender-colored tights, with red velvet breeches and a
green doublet slashed with yellow; to have a light-blue silk cloak on my
shoulder, and a black eagle's plume waving from my hat, and a big sword,
and a falcon, and a lance, and a prancing horse, so that I might go
about and gladden the eyes of the people. Why should we all try to look
like ants crawling over a dust-heap? Why shouldn't we dress a little
gayly? I am sure if we did we should be happier. True, it is a little
thing, but we are a little race, and what is the use of our pretending
otherwise and spoiling fun? Let philosophers get themselves up like old
crows if they like. But let me be a butterfly.

Women, at all events, ought to dress prettily. It is their duty. They
are the flowers of the earth and were meant to show it up. We abuse them
a good deal, we men; but, goodness knows, the old world would be dull
enough without their dresses and fair faces. How they brighten up
every place they come into! What a sunny commotion they--relations,
of course---make in our dingy bachelor chambers! and what a delightful
litter their ribbons and laces, and gloves and hats, and parasols and
'kerchiefs make! It is as if a wandering rainbow had dropped in to pay
us a visit.

It is one of the chief charms of the summer, to my mind, the way our
little maids come out in pretty colors. I like to see the pink and blue
and white glancing between the trees, dotting the green fields, and
flashing back the sunlight. You can see the bright colors such a long
way off. There are four white dresses climbing a hill in front of my
window now. I can see them distinctly, though it is three miles away. I
thought at first they were mile-stones out for a lark. It's so nice to
be able to see the darlings a long way off. Especially if they happen to
be your wife and your mother-in-law.

Talking of fields and mile-stones reminds me that I want to say, in all
seriousness, a few words about women's boots. The women of these islands
all wear boots too big for them. They can never get a boot to fit. The
bootmakers do not keep sizes small enough.

Over and over again have I known women sit down on the top rail of a
stile and declare they could not go a step further because their boots
hurt them so; and it has always been the same complaint--too big.

It is time this state of things was altered. In the name of the husbands
and fathers of England, I call upon the bootmakers to reform. Our wives,
our daughters, and our cousins are not to be lamed and tortured with
impunity. Why cannot "narrow twos" be kept more in stock? That is the
size I find most women take.

The waist-band is another item of feminine apparel that is always too
big. The dressmakers make these things so loose that the hooks and eyes
by which they are fastened burst off, every now and then, with a report
like thunder.

Why women suffer these wrongs--why they do not insist in having their
clothes made small enough for them I cannot conceive. It can hardly be
that they are disinclined to trouble themselves about matters of mere
dress, for dress is the one subject that they really do think about. It
is the only topic they ever get thoroughly interested in, and they talk
about it all day long. If you see two women together, you may bet your
bottom dollar they are discussing their own or their friends' clothes.
You notice a couple of child-like beings conversing by a window, and you
wonder what sweet, helpful words are falling from their sainted lips. So
you move nearer and then you hear one say:

"So I took in the waist-band and let out a seam, and it fits beautifully
now."

"Well," says the other, "I shall wear my plum-colored body to the
Jones', with a yellow plastron; and they've got some lovely gloves at
Puttick's, only one and eleven pence."

I went for a drive through a part of Derbyshire once with a couple of
ladies. It was a beautiful bit of country, and they enjoyed themselves
immensely. They talked dressmaking the whole time.

"Pretty view, that," I would say, waving my umbrella round. "Look at
those blue distant hills! That little white speck, nestling in the
woods, is Chatsworth, and over there--"

"Yes, very pretty indeed," one would reply. "Well, why not get a yard of
sarsenet?"

"What, and leave the skirt exactly as it is?"

"Certainly. What place d'ye call this?"

Then I would draw their attention to the fresh beauties that kept
sweeping into view, and they would glance round and say "charming,"
"sweetly pretty," and immediately go off into raptures over each other's
pocket-handkerchiefs, and mourn with one another over the decadence of
cambric frilling.

I believe if two women were cast together upon a desert island, they
would spend each day arguing the respective merits of sea-shells and
birds' eggs considered as trimmings, and would have a new fashion in
fig-leaves every month.

Very young men think a good deal about clothes, but they don't talk
about them to each other. They would not find much encouragement. A fop
is not a favorite with his own sex. Indeed, he gets a good deal more
abuse from them than is necessary. His is a harmless failing and it
soon wears out. Besides, a man who has no foppery at twenty will be
a slatternly, dirty-collar, unbrushed-coat man at forty. A little
foppishness in a young man is good; it is human. I like to see a young
cock ruffle his feathers, stretch his neck, and crow as if the whole
world belonged to him. I don't like a modest, retiring man. Nobody
does--not really, however much they may prate about modest worth and
other things they do not understand.

A meek deportment is a great mistake in the world. Uriah Heap's father
was a very poor judge of human nature, or he would not have told his
son, as he did, that people liked humbleness. There is nothing annoys
them more, as a rule. Rows are half the fun of life, and you can't have
rows with humble, meek-answering individuals. They turn away our wrath,
and that is just what we do not want. We want to let it out. We have
worked ourselves up into a state of exhilarating fury, and then just as
we are anticipating the enjoyment of a vigorous set-to, they spoil all
our plans with their exasperating humility.

Xantippe's life must have been one long misery, tied to that calmly
irritating man, Socrates. Fancy a married woman doomed to live on from
day to day without one single quarrel with her husband! A man ought to
humor his wife in these things.

Heaven knows their lives are dull enough, poor girls. They have none of
the enjoyments we have. They go to no political meetings; they may not
even belong to the local amateur parliament; they are excluded from
smoking-carriages on the Metropolitan Railway, and they never see a
comic paper--or if they do, they do not know it is comic: nobody tells
them.

Surely, with existence such a dreary blank for them as this, we might
provide a little row for their amusement now and then, even if we do
not feel inclined for it ourselves. A really sensible man does so and is
loved accordingly, for it is little acts of kindness such as this
that go straight to a woman's heart. It is such like proofs of loving
self-sacrifice that make her tell her female friends what a good husband
he was--after he is dead.

Yes, poor Xantippe must have had a hard time of it. The bucket episode
was particularly sad for her. Poor woman! she did think she would rouse
him up a bit with that. She had taken the trouble to fill the bucket,
perhaps been a long way to get specially dirty water. And she waited for
him. And then to be met in such a way, after all! Most likely she sat
down and had a good cry afterward. It must have seemed all so hopeless
to the poor child; and for all we know she had no mother to whom she
could go and abuse him.

What was it to her that her husband was a great philosopher? Great
philosophy don't count in married life.

There was a very good little boy once who wanted to go to sea. And
the captain asked him what he could do. He said he could do the
multiplication-table backward and paste sea-weed in a book; that he knew
how many times the word "begat" occurred in the Old Testament; and could
recite "The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck" and Wordsworth's "We Are
Seven."

"Werry good--werry good, indeed," said the man of the sea, "and ken ye
kerry coals?"

It is just the same when you want to marry. Great ability is not
required so much as little usefulness. Brains are at a discount in the
married state. There is no demand for them, no appreciation even.
Our wives sum us up according to a standard of their own, in which
brilliancy of intellect obtains no marks. Your lady and mistress is not
at all impressed by your cleverness and talent, my dear reader--not
in the slightest. Give her a man who can do an errand neatly, without
attempting to use his own judgment over it or any nonsense of that kind;
and who can be trusted to hold a child the right way up, and not make
himself objectionable whenever there is lukewarm mutton for dinner.
That is the sort of a husband a sensible woman likes; not one of your
scientific or literary nuisances, who go upsetting the whole house and
putting everybody out with their foolishness.




ON MEMORY.

     "I remember, I remember,
     In the days of chill November,
     How the blackbird on the--"

I forget the rest. It is the beginning of the first piece of poetry I
ever learned; for

     "Hey, diddle diddle,
     The cat and the fiddle,"

I take no note of, it being of a frivolous character and lacking in the
qualities of true poetry. I collected fourpence by the recital of "I
remember, I remember." I knew it was fourpence, because they told me
that if I kept it until I got twopence more I should have sixpence,
which argument, albeit undeniable, moved me not, and the money was
squandered, to the best of my recollection, on the very next morning,
although upon what memory is a blank.

That is just the way with Memory; nothing that she brings to us is
complete. She is a willful child; all her toys are broken. I remember
tumbling into a huge dust-hole when a very small boy, but I have not the
faintest recollection of ever getting out again; and if memory were all
we had to trust to, I should be compelled to believe I was there still.

At another time--some years later--I was assisting at an exceedingly
interesting love scene; but the only thing about it I can call to mind
distinctly is that at the most critical moment somebody suddenly opened
the door and said, "Emily, you're wanted," in a sepulchral tone that
gave one the idea the police had come for her. All the tender words
she said to me and all the beautiful things I said to her are utterly
forgotten.

Life altogether is but a crumbling ruin when we turn to look behind: a
shattered column here, where a massive portal stood; the broken shaft
of a window to mark my lady's bower; and a moldering heap of blackened
stones where the glowing flames once leaped, and over all the tinted
lichen and the ivy clinging green.

For everything looms pleasant through the softening haze of time. Even
the sadness that is past seems sweet. Our boyish days look very merry to
us now, all nutting, hoop, and gingerbread. The snubbings and toothaches
and the Latin verbs are all forgotten--the Latin verbs especially. And
we fancy we were very happy when we were hobbledehoys and loved; and we
wish that we could love again. We never think of the heartaches, or the
sleepless nights, or the hot dryness of our throats, when she said she
could never be anything to us but a sister--as if any man wanted more
sisters!

Yes, it is the brightness, not the darkness, that we see when we look
back. The sunshine casts no shadows on the past. The road that we have
traversed stretches very fair behind us. We see not the sharp stones. We
dwell but on the roses by the wayside, and the strong briers that stung
us are, to our distant eyes, but gentle tendrils waving in the wind. God
be thanked that it is so--that the ever-lengthening chain of memory has
only pleasant links, and that the bitterness and sorrow of to-day are
smiled at on the morrow.

It seems as though the brightest side of everything were also its
highest and best, so that as our little lives sink back behind us into
the dark sea of forgetfulness, all that which is the lightest and the
most gladsome is the last to sink, and stands above the waters, long in
sight, when the angry thoughts and smarting pain are buried deep below
the waves and trouble us no more.

It is this glamour of the past, I suppose, that makes old folk talk so
much nonsense about the days when they were young. The world appears to
have been a very superior sort of place then, and things were more
like what they ought to be. Boys were boys then, and girls were very
different. Also winters were something like winters, and summers not
at all the wretched-things we get put off with nowadays. As for the
wonderful deeds people did in those times and the extraordinary events
that happened, it takes three strong men to believe half of them.

I like to hear one of the old boys telling all about it to a party
of youngsters who he knows cannot contradict him. It is odd if, after
awhile, he doesn't swear that the moon shone every night when he was a
boy, and that tossing mad bulls in a blanket was the favorite sport at
his school.

It always has been and always will be the same. The old folk of our
grandfathers' young days sang a song bearing exactly the same burden;
and the young folk of to-day will drone out precisely similar nonsense
for the aggravation of the next generation. "Oh, give me back the
good old days of fifty years ago," has been the cry ever since Adam's
fifty-first birthday. Take up the literature of 1835, and you will find
the poets and novelists asking for the same impossible gift as did the
German Minnesingers long before them and the old Norse Saga writers long
before that. And for the same thing sighed the early prophets and the
philosophers of ancient Greece. From all accounts, the world has been
getting worse and worse ever since it was created. All I can say is that
it must have been a remarkably delightful place when it was first opened
to the public, for it is very pleasant even now if you only keep as much
as possible in the sunshine and take the rain good-temperedly.

Yet there is no gainsaying but that it must have been somewhat sweeter
in that dewy morning of creation, when it was young and fresh, when the
feet of the tramping millions had not trodden its grass to dust, nor the
din of the myriad cities chased the silence forever away. Life must have
been noble and solemn to those free-footed, loose-robed fathers of the
human race, walking hand in hand with God under the great sky. They
lived in sunkissed tents amid the lowing herds. They took their simple
wants from the loving hand of Nature. They toiled and talked and
thought; and the great earth rolled around in stillness, not yet laden
with trouble and wrong.

Those days are past now. The quiet childhood of Humanity, spent in the
far-off forest glades and by the murmuring rivers, is gone forever; and
human life is deepening down to manhood amid tumult, doubt, and hope.
Its age of restful peace is past. It has its work to finish and must
hasten on. What that work may be--what this world's share is in the
great design--we know not, though our unconscious hands are helping to
accomplish it. Like the tiny coral insect working deep under the dark
waters, we strive and struggle each for our own little ends, nor dream
of the vast fabric we are building up for God.

Let us have done with vain regrets and longings for the days that
never will be ours again. Our work lies in front, not behind us; and
"Forward!" is our motto. Let us not sit with folded hands, gazing upon
the past as if it were the building; it is but the foundation. Let us
not waste heart and life thinking of what might have been and forgetting
the may be that lies before us. Opportunities flit by while we sit
regretting the chances we have lost, and the happiness that comes to us
we heed not, because of the happiness that is gone.

Years ago, when I used to wander of an evening from the fireside to
the pleasant land of fairy-tales, I met a doughty knight and true. Many
dangers had he overcome, in many lands had been; and all men knew him
for a brave and well-tried knight, and one that knew not fear; except,
maybe, upon such seasons when even a brave man might feel afraid and yet
not be ashamed. Now, as this knight one day was pricking wearily along a
toilsome road, his heart misgave him and was sore within him because of
the trouble of the way. Rocks, dark and of a monstrous size, hung high
above his head, and like enough it seemed unto the knight that they
should fall and he lie low beneath them. Chasms there were on either
side, and darksome caves wherein fierce robbers lived, and dragons,
very terrible, whose jaws dripped blood. And upon the road there hung a
darkness as of night. So it came over that good knight that he would no
more press forward, but seek another road, less grievously beset with
difficulty unto his gentle steed. But when in haste he turned and looked
behind, much marveled our brave knight, for lo! of all the way that he
had ridden there was naught for eye to see; but at his horse's heels
there yawned a mighty gulf, whereof no man might ever spy the bottom,
so deep was that same gulf. Then when Sir Ghelent saw that of going back
there was none, he prayed to good Saint Cuthbert, and setting spurs into
his steed rode forward bravely and most joyously. And naught harmed him.

There is no returning on the road of life. The frail bridge of time on
which we tread sinks back into eternity at every step we take. The past
is gone from us forever. It is gathered in and garnered. It belongs
to us no more. No single word can ever be unspoken; no single step
retraced. Therefore it beseems us as true knights to prick on bravely,
not idly weep because we cannot now recall.

A new life begins for us with every second. Let us go forward joyously
to meet it. We must press on whether we will or no, and we shall walk
better with our eyes before us than with them ever cast behind.

A friend came to me the other day and urged me very eloquently to learn
some wonderful system by which you never forgot anything. I don't know
why he was so eager on the subject, unless it be that I occasionally
borrow an umbrella and have a knack of coming out, in the middle of a
game of whist, with a mild "Lor! I've been thinking all along that
clubs were trumps." I declined the suggestion, however, in spite of
the advantages he so attractively set forth. I have no wish to remember
everything. There are many things in most men's lives that had better be
forgotten. There is that time, many years ago, when we did not act quite
as honorably, quite as uprightly, as we perhaps should have done--that
unfortunate deviation from the path of strict probity we once committed,
and in which, more unfortunate still, we were found out--that act of
folly, of meanness, of wrong. Ah, well! we paid the penalty, suffered
the maddening hours of vain remorse, the hot agony of shame, the scorn,
perhaps, of those we loved. Let us forget. Oh, Father Time, lift with
your kindly hands those bitter memories from off our overburdened
hearts, for griefs are ever coming to us with the coming hours, and our
little strength is only as the day.

Not that the past should be buried. The music of life would be mute
if the chords of memory were snapped asunder. It is but the poisonous
weeds, not the flowers, that we should root out from the garden of
Mnemosyne. Do you remember Dickens' "Haunted Man"--how he prayed for
forgetfulness, and how, when his prayer was answered, he prayed for
memory once more? We do not want all the ghosts laid. It is only the
haggard, cruel-eyed specters that we flee from. Let the gentle, kindly
phantoms haunt us as they will; we are not afraid of them.

Ah me! the world grows very full of ghosts as we grow older. We need
not seek in dismal church-yards nor sleep in moated granges to see the
shadowy faces and hear the rustling of their garments in the night.
Every house, every room, every creaking chair has its own particular
ghost. They haunt the empty chambers of our lives, they throng around us
like dead leaves whirled in the autumn wind. Some are living, some are
dead. We know not. We clasped their hands once, loved them, quarreled
with them, laughed with them, told them our thoughts and hopes and aims,
as they told us theirs, till it seemed our very hearts had joined in a
grip that would defy the puny power of Death. They are gone now; lost to
us forever. Their eyes will never look into ours again and their voices
we shall never hear. Only their ghosts come to us and talk with us. We
see them, dim and shadowy, through our tears. We stretch our yearning
hands to them, but they are air.

Ghosts! They are with us night and day. They walk beside us in the busy
street under the glare of the sun. They sit by us in the twilight at
home. We see their little faces looking from the windows of the old
school-house. We meet them in the woods and lanes where we shouted and
played as boys. Hark! cannot you hear their low laughter from behind the
blackberry-bushes and their distant whoops along the grassy glades?
Down here, through the quiet fields and by the wood, where the evening
shadows are lurking, winds the path where we used to watch for her at
sunset. Look, she is there now, in the dainty white frock we knew so
well, with the big bonnet dangling from her little hands and the sunny
brown hair all tangled. Five thousand miles away! Dead for all we know!
What of that? She is beside us now, and we can look into her laughing
eyes and hear her voice. She will vanish at the stile by the wood and we
shall be alone; and the shadows will creep out across the fields and the
night wind will sweep past moaning. Ghosts! they are always with us and
always will be while the sad old world keeps echoing to the sob of long
good-bys, while the cruel ships sail away across the great seas, and the
cold green earth lies heavy on the hearts of those we loved.

But, oh, ghosts, the world would be sadder still without you. Come to
us and speak to us, oh you ghosts of our old loves! Ghosts of playmates,
and of sweethearts, and old friends, of all you laughing boys and girls,
oh, come to us and be with us, for the world is very lonely, and new
friends and faces are not like the old, and we cannot love them, nay,
nor laugh with them as we have loved and laughed with you. And when we
walked together, oh, ghosts of our youth, the world was very gay and
bright; but now it has grown old and we are growing weary, and only you
can bring the brightness and the freshness back to us.

Memory is a rare ghost-raiser. Like a haunted house, its walls are
ever echoing to unseen feet. Through the broken casements we watch the
flitting shadows of the dead, and the saddest shadows of them all are
the shadows of our own dead selves.

Oh, those young bright faces, so full of truth and honor, of pure, good
thoughts, of noble longings, how reproachfully they look upon us with
their deep, clear eyes!

I fear they have good cause for their sorrow, poor lads. Lies and
cunning and disbelief have crept into our hearts since those preshaving
days--and we meant to be so great and good.

It is well we cannot see into the future. There are few boys of fourteen
who would not feel ashamed of themselves at forty.

I like to sit and have a talk sometimes with that odd little chap that
was myself long ago. I think he likes it too, for he comes so often of
an evening when I am alone with my pipe, listening to the whispering
of the flames. I see his solemn little face looking at me through the
scented smoke as it floats upward, and I smile at him; and he smiles
back at me, but his is such a grave, old-fashioned smile. We chat about
old times; and now and then he takes me by the hand, and then we slip
through the black bars of the grate and down the dusky glowing caves
to the land that lies behind the firelight. There we find the days that
used to be, and we wander along them together. He tells me as we walk
all he thinks and feels. I laugh at him now and then, but the next
moment I wish I had not, for he looks so grave I am ashamed of being
frivolous. Besides, it is not showing proper respect to one so much
older than myself--to one who was myself so very long before I became
myself.

We don't talk much at first, but look at one another; I down at his
curly hair and little blue bow, he up sideways at me as he trots. And
some-how I fancy the shy, round eyes do not altogether approve of me,
and he heaves a little sigh, as though he were disappointed. But after
awhile his bashfulness wears off and he begins to chat. He tells me
his favorite fairy-tales, he can do up to six times, and he has a
guinea-pig, and pa says fairy-tales ain't true; and isn't it a pity?
'cos he would so like to be a knight and fight a dragon and marry a
beautiful princess. But he takes a more practical view of life when he
reaches seven, and would prefer to grow up be a bargee, and earn a lot
of money. Maybe this is the consequence of falling in love, which he
does about this time with the young lady at the milk shop aet. six. (God
bless her little ever-dancing feet, whatever size they may be now!)
He must be very fond of her, for he gives her one day his chiefest
treasure, to wit, a huge pocket-knife with four rusty blades and a
corkscrew, which latter has a knack of working itself out in some
mysterious manner and sticking into its owner's leg. She is an
affectionate little thing, and she throws her arms round his neck and
kisses him for it, then and there, outside the shop. But the stupid
world (in the person of the boy at the cigar emporium next door) jeers
at such tokens of love. Whereupon my young friend very properly prepares
to punch the head of the boy at the cigar emporium next door; but fails
in the attempt, the boy at the cigar emporium next door punching his
instead.

And then comes school life, with its bitter little sorrows and its
joyous shoutings, its jolly larks, and its hot tears falling on beastly
Latin grammars and silly old copy-books. It is at school that he injures
himself for life--as I firmly believe--trying to pronounce German;
and it is there, too, that he learns of the importance attached by the
French nation to pens, ink, and paper. "Have you pens, ink, and paper?"
is the first question asked by one Frenchman of another on their
meeting. The other fellow has not any of them, as a rule, but says
that the uncle of his brother has got them all three. The first fellow
doesn't appear to care a hang about the uncle of the other fellow's
brother; what he wants to know now is, has the neighbor of the other
fellow's mother got 'em? "The neighbor of my mother has no pens, no ink,
and no paper," replies the other man, beginning to get wild. "Has the
child of thy female gardener some pens, some ink, or some paper?" He has
him there. After worrying enough about these wretched inks, pens, and
paper to make everybody miserable, it turns out that the child of his
own female gardener hasn't any. Such a discovery would shut up any one
but a French exercise man. It has no effect at all, though, on this
shameless creature. He never thinks of apologizing, but says his aunt
has some mustard.

So in the acquisition of more or less useless knowledge, soon happily to
be forgotten, boyhood passes away. The red-brick school-house fades from
view, and we turn down into the world's high-road. My little friend is
no longer little now. The short jacket has sprouted tails. The battered
cap, so useful as a combination of pocket-handkerchief, drinking-cup,
and weapon of attack, has grown high and glossy; and instead of a
slate-pencil in his mouth there is a cigarette, the smoke of which
troubles him, for it will get up his nose. He tries a cigar a little
later on as being more stylish--a big black Havanna. It doesn't seem
altogether to agree with him, for I find him sitting over a bucket in
the back kitchen afterward, solemnly swearing never to smoke again.

And now his mustache begins to be almost visible to the naked eye,
whereupon he immediately takes to brandy-and-sodas and fancies himself
a man. He talks about "two to one against the favorite," refers to
actresses as "Little Emmy" and "Kate" and "Baby," and murmurs about his
"losses at cards the other night" in a style implying that thousands
have been squandered, though, to do him justice, the actual amount is
most probably one-and-twopence. Also, if I see aright--for it is always
twilight in this land of memories--he sticks an eyeglass in his eye and
stumbles over everything.

His female relations, much troubled at these things, pray for him (bless
their gentle hearts!) and see visions of Old Bailey trials and halters
as the only possible outcome of such reckless dissipation; and the
prediction of his first school-master, that he would come to a bad end,
assumes the proportions of inspired prophecy.

He has a lordly contempt at this age for the other sex, a blatantly good
opinion of himself, and a sociably patronizing manner toward all the
elderly male friends of the family. Altogether, it must be confessed, he
is somewhat of a nuisance about this time.

It does not last long, though. He falls in love in a little while, and
that soon takes the bounce out of him. I notice his boots are much too
small for him now, and his hair is fearfully and wonderfully arranged.
He reads poetry more than he used, and he keeps a rhyming dictionary in
his bedroom. Every morning Emily Jane finds scraps of torn-up paper on
the floor and reads thereon of "cruel hearts and love's deep darts," of
"beauteous eyes and lovers' sighs," and much more of the old, old song
that lads so love to sing and lassies love to listen to while giving
their dainty heads a toss and pretending never to hear.

The course of love, however, seems not to have run smoothly, for later
on he takes more walking exercise and less sleep, poor boy, than is good
for him; and his face is suggestive of anything but wedding-bells and
happiness ever after.

And here he seems to vanish. The little, boyish self that has grown up
beside me as we walked is gone.

I am alone and the road is very dark. I stumble on, I know not how nor
care, for the way seems leading nowhere, and there is no light to guide.

But at last the morning comes, and I find that I have grown into myself.

THE END.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
